Quite simply put, gender equality refers to men and women being offered equal opportunities within all facets of society. Observing this topic from the surface, the concept seems to be a rather basic, easily-comprehensible one. However, a multiplicity of issues and perspectives surround these two simple words, and much-heated debate and argument are arising amongst people who are all essentially fighting for the same cause.

Taking a look at the two terms most commonly associated with gender equality, the definition of each is as follows according to Oxford Dictionary:

1. _Egalitarianism_ – the doctrine that all people are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities
2. _Feminism_ – advocacy of women’s rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes

In short, both support the concept of providing equal opportunity regardless of gender. So why do separate terms exist?

The first cause of the disparity is a contrasting perspective on which end of the spectrum is the one that needs to be elevated to match up to the needs of the other. Amongst those passionately against feminism are those who believe that men are actually the ones being increasingly underrepresented. This viewpoint finds its groundwork within the existence of stereotypes that men are less capable or less competent in comparison to women. Differences in working environments for the two genders is also serving as a source of controversy: If a company offers lenient maternity and menstrual leave, is this putting men in a disadvantageous position by not offering the same kind of situational benefits? Or is this an act that balances out the working conditions of men and women by taking note of the physical disadvantages that are unavoidable in women?

The latter question brings attention to those who believe that females have been and still remain the underrepresented gender. Out of this segment, those who do not like being associated with the word “feminism” are the ones who typically classify themselves as being equalist (equalism is a form of egalitarianism). The biggest reason for such tendencies to avoid the word “feminism” stems from the impression that the word “feminist” indicates a support for the belief that women should be superior or the propensity to be anti-male. In response, feminism advocates have very actively rebutted this particular view with the justification that feminism is not a movement that seeks to rise above the opposite gender – it is instead a movement that believes females need greater privileges and social acceptance in order to make the two genders equal.

In this manner, the feminists have very openly clarified the misconceptions surrounding the word “feminism,” and yet, hardly any equalists have chosen to take up the feminist campaign, most likely because of the existence of deeper differences that exist in relevance to the issue. A fact that most forget to take into account is that every individual has a different perception of the specific extent to which certain issues indicate gender imbalance and the extent to which other issues do not. For example, let us reconsider the issue of maternity and menstrual leave (one of the biggest women’s rights issues within South Korea). A feminist may advocate for this privilege because he or she believes it is an act that makes working conditions between the two genders equal. However, an anti-feminist may view this as an instance that is favorably biased towards women. In this instance, the anti-feminist’s perception that feminists tend to support women superiority would not be altered, regardless of whether the feminist sector actually believes that women should be made more superior through this working condition alteration or not.

All of these conflicting views withstanding, the feminism movement remains the group that is currently gaining the most publicity and widespread attention in regards to gender equality. Movements for the feminist movement have been receiving quite a lot of traction in recent years as many influential female celebrities with a wide base of supporters and a positive media-empowered image have been taking the reins on the issue. Much to the great interest of the public, actress Emma Watson became appointed a UN Women Goodwill ambassador in the summer of 2014. In the same year, Watson delivered a self-written speech to honor the launching of a campaign called “HeForShe.” Within this speech, Watson unleashed yet another unaddressed approach to gender equality which served as the basis for the campaign: “I’ve seen young men suffering from mental illness unable to ask for help for fear it would make them look less ‘macho’…men don’t have the benefits of equality either. We don’t often talk about men being imprisoned by gender stereotypes but I can see that they are and that when they’re free, things will change for women as a natural consequence…If men don’t have to control, women don’t have to be controlled.”

This third viewpoint argues that gender stereotypes exist for both genders, not just for one or the other – the need for a women’s rights movement exists because the male stereotype entails that males exert a certain amount of control over the opposite sex. The result is that women end up with less opportunity to emphasize their opinions or expand their influence. Thus, gender equality cannot be accomplished without the participation of males as well as females, hence the name “HeForShe,” where males work for the equal representation of females and in turn get liberated from their own gender stereotypes as well.

This interpretation certainly deserves as much merit as the stunning amount of publicity it received. However, it brings up the question of whether it is physically possible for true gender equality to ever be achieved. What is the fine line between “control” and consideration for the physical female characteristics that undeniably serve as handicaps in certain situations? The obstacles to achieving genuine gender equality begin to make their unfavorable appearance once day-to-day events are magnified down to the nitty-gritty details.

Midway through my last year in high school, my school band was loading a truck with equipment for an outdoor concert. I vividly remember how my female friend had been getting ready to haul one of our biggest bass amps onto the truck when another male student took the amp from her arms and told her to load other lighter objects. Being a friend who took immense pride in her strength, she had complained that she would not have voluntarily lifted the amp if she knew she could not do it. Upon the conclusion of the event, the band instructor mentioned that he would like to see more of the female students helping out at the next performance. To this remark, the aforementioned Friend A complained about how she was supposed to help out when there were people who assumed she could not move equipment just because she was a girl. Another Friend B expressed that she did not understand how she could have helped when all of the equipment had been too heavy for her to lift.

The boy who had lifted the amp had taken into consideration the anatomical differences that undoubtedly limit the strength of certain females over males. The band instructor had chosen to adopt the idea that females are just as capable of helping out as males. Which person had been the one acting in support of gender equality? Which was the one exerting “control” and gender stereotype over the females? It is impossible to come up with a single correct answer because it is all a matter of perspective – the interpretation of the situation depends on whether one chooses to stand in the shoes of female friend A or B.

In conclusion, the three main stances supporting the gender equality issue (1. Men are underrepresented, 2. Women are underrepresented, 3. Both are misrepresented) all hold a certain amount of truth. The fact of the matter is that males and females are fundamentally not the same, and this will always result in an ongoing debate over which solution is more effective at balancing out this preexisting fundamental difference. The ideal form of gender equality involves not the degree to which the two genders have been made "equal” or which supporter of gender equality they should categorize themselves into, but striving to eliminate the possibilities of having someone unable to expand to full potential because of the gender he or she is born with.

And if society’s definition of gender equality can be broadened out into encompassing this single, common goal, gender equality, in all its unattractive potential to sprout an infinity of conflicting dichotomies, may indeed be possible of success.
