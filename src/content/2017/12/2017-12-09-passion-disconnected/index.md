Here we are, in the year of 2017, when the whole world seems to have broken down into minuscule particles of dust, laboriously trying to blow each other away. Just five months ahead of the quadrennial Winter Olympics, a hallmark of peace and connectivity, the host country seems to have failed to live up to its heartening slogan. Starting with the pandemonium caused by political parties and their groupies, to the dispute between victims of either the mandatory military subscription or the glass ceiling, to anonymous online roasts by angry nerds directed at each other’s universities, it seems we have entered an age of disconnection...and much localized passion. Of course, these clashing personalities share a common feature--they share a heated passion to debate over differing perspectives. Sadly, we have all witnessed a number of cases where debates have degenerated into brawls and common etiquette into inflammatory behavior. Problems begin to arise when debaters shut all eyes and ears to possibilities outside their caves of shadows.

In an age of interweaving networks and the widespread use of social platforms, where we are taught and raised to become open-minded to new and different opinions, why is it that the people of today have become more estranged from others, and less eager to listen?

Social division rarely occurs in the piping times of peace. Rather, it feeds on societies in which its people experience times of uncertainty and anxiety. An average citizen in Korea can observe the defects that our society today contains: our futures are blurrier than ever, competition has never been this fierce, and the declining pool of resources fails to accommodate all, fueling our anxiety and fear of falling behind. Whereas the period of rapid development led to all sorts of expansion,—in particular, the workforce and economy—modern society seems to show a stall or a decline in resources that are in serious demand. Human workforce, for example, is being replaced by machines and robots. Entry barriers for permanent positions have soared higher than ever. Youth unemployment rates have reached an all-high in August 2017, in 18 years. These disturbing uncertainties lead university students to engage in constant online warfare, proving themselves over others by putting a ranking on professions, schools and majors that are best advantaged in getting a job. At first notice, we can see the brawl between the fields of liberal arts and the natural sciences. Look a little closer and we can spot another division within liberal arts, between economics/business departments and the humanities. The list goes on and on.

It seems that when times are hard and life has turned into an ever-competitive zero-sum game, stepping over any potential competition becomes key to safeguard our interests and positions. We find ourselves becoming more self-centered. We conclude that the prerequisites for winning this game we call “life” are: to establish hierarchies and consider any opposing view an invention of our foes. To discriminate others based on gender, political affiliation, age, or educational backgrounds—but always in our favor. In a world where the winner takes it all, the uncertainty of our place and future discourages us from seeking answers to virtuous questions and debate. We spend too much time proving ourselves to be right and a winner.

Psychological factors also endorse division. It seems as though living according to one’s due are now a thing of the past. People now want to enjoy all the luxuries in life. Our endless desires, together with our endless comparisons to others dissuade us from ever feeling satisfied and sufficient. Social media platforms have largely contributed to the evolution of this psyche. We upload the lives we want others to think we have. We hide behind the screen of our imaginary worlds when posting “the perfect selfie” (only after the arduous process of “taking about 300 photos until you get the right selfie”, in the words of reality TV star Kim Kardashian). Wishing our lives were as fabulous as the seeming lives of others, we crave for the better things in life, even if they are far out-of-reach. This mindset gives way to a sense of relative deprivation and feelings of detachment from others, instigating division.

Other causes can be found in the political arena, whose influence permeates our everyday lives. The period of hardship has brought about discontent and anguish onto the toiling masses, leading many to see or hear what they want to believe. Meanwhile, we are constantly made vulnerable to incitement by demagogues who aggravate social division for the benefit of their political careers or parties. Admittedly, politics has always been a tug-of-war between different interest groups. Yet the recent political drama, featuring the impeachment of President Park, caused aggression and radical divide of left and right among the people. In the midst of this frenzy, politicians added fuel to the fire by using deceptive politics and the “us versus them” repertoire, pressuring us to pick a side. However, we are well aware that the world can’t be seen in black and white, as can’t political issues or national policies. Politicians, overlooking a large gray area in the middle, created another ideological dichotomy, which only added onto our current social disharmony.

A single passion, when brought together and shared by many, has the power to shift the paradigm. As a slogan for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics reads: “Passion, in its various forms, changes the world.” By connecting passion, Pyeongchang 2018 aims to connect people, places, and possibilities, and ultimately promote peace. Embodying this Olympic spirit, it is certainly worth hoping that the host country gets better and more inclusive over time as well—that the deep cracks in our current economy, psychology, and politics become mended. In the meantime, we should find more trust and faith in ourselves and others, open our hearts a little wider, and find the breadth of mind to listen and empathize—gracefully embrace the uncertainties of change and turn this bleak life around.
