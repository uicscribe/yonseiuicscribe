Grade inflation, which is defined as an increase in the average grade of college students, has become a major discussion topic in the last couple of years. Many believe that this rapid increase is not necessarily the result of more studious and diligent students, but of more lenient grading policies by academic institutions.

In South Korea, grade inflation had been addressed before it was recognized as a problem. Most higher education institutions in Korea have a “grading on a curve” policy that allocates strict percentages for each letter grade. This is also commonly referred to as a grade _de_flation practice. The intention behind it is to not only maintain consistent standards across all departments, but also promote a sense of competition so that students can be motivated to perform better.

But what if this system backfired?

In 2005, Princeton University implemented a grade deflation policy in which only a maximum of 35% of the students could receive a letter A grade for coursework. It was found that this policy “\[added\] a large element of stress to students’ lives, making them feel as though they are competing for a limited resource of A grades.” In 2014, this practice changed. The university opted for a removal of numerical targets and replaced them with a set of grading standards developed by each department and approved by the dean of the college. Additionally, they also changed their focus from grading to giving more quality feedback.

Struggling for a limited amount of A’s can drastically change the perception of education that students have and their approach to it. A competitive spirit becomes toxic when students no longer walk into a classroom with the purpose of learning, but with the preoccupation with incessant competition. The paranoid revolving around the pressure to absorb information can easily result in passive, instead of active, interaction with the content. And this translates into a cycle of one-sided absorption and reproduction, which leaves little space for critical thinking.

In 2016, _The New York Times_ published an opinion article titled “Why We Should Stop Grading Students on a Curve.” Adam Grant, a professor of management and psychology at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, conducted an experiment with the objective of creating a collaborative culture among his students. Grant told his students that he would only curve their grades upward, meaning that even if one student got a higher grade it would not hurt the rest.

Then, Grant increased the difficulty of his exams. In this case, what really pushed the students to work cooperatively was the addition of a multiple choice section at the end of his exams. Students were allowed to choose one of the four questions and write the name of one of their classmates who they thought would know the answer. If their classmate answered correctly, they would both earn points. As a result of Grant’s experiment, more students started to form study groups. This cooperative environment showed a two percent increase in the grades in comparison to the previous year.

These observations may face skepticism in a competitive society as the one in South Korea. Some may argue that maintaining a cap on grades, and thus on the GPA of students, is necessary in South Korea since these numbers become highly relevant for individuals’ employability after graduation. It has been a common practice for companies in South Korea to require applicants’ GPA during their screening process. However, this process might be soon left in the past.

As of September of this year, the Korean government has implemented a policy of blind recruitment for all public jobs. The government has also expressed an interest to extend this policy to the private sector in the future. This policy will leave out the applicants’ hometown, alma mater, and GPA, among other things. While the new policy has been met with some counterarguments, a survey by JobKorea has shown that the majority of respondents agree with the new policy.

This new blind employment policy may dismiss some of the initial anxiety toward removing grade deflation policies. In a society that does not focus on workers’ GPA, but on their competence and efficiency, grade deflation practices in higher institutions are no longer necessary. By removing grade deflation practices, higher education institutions can promote a more cooperative environment in which students are no longer passive subjects, but active agents and competent individuals prepared to  join the workforce.
