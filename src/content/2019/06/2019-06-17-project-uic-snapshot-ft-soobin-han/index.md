This week we will meet Soobin Han, who just came back from an Exchange program at Waseda University in Japan!

**Waseda University is one of the most prestigious universities in Japan. What did you most enjoyed about it?**

> What I loved most about Waseda SILS department is the wide range of classes it provides. As a liberal arts college like Yonsei UIC, SILS tries to cultivate wholistic learning environment in which interdisciplinary knowledges are taught and learned. For instance, I took classes on Middle Eastern studies and ancient Greek philosophy and was able to draw some meaningful connections.

**Did you have any goal for your exchange program before you leave? Did you achieve it?**

> Yes, my goals were to polish my Japanese skill and gain deeper understanding of Japanese culture. My second foreign language is Japanese but I did not have enough chance to use it in daily basis in Korea. I hoped living in Japan will allow me to learn more day-to-day expressions. So far, I improved to the degree that I can launch some interesting conversation with native Japanese speakers.

**What do you plan for next semester, back in Yonsei University?**

> I am planning pursuit a profession of law, so I will most likely to study for LEET or seek some internship opportunities. I am also looking forward to share my knowledge acquired in Japan with my fellow classmates.
