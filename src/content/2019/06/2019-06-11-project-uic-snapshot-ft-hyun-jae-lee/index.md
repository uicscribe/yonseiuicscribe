You just came back from an Exchange Program! 

Please tell us about where you have studied.

> I studied at Wellesley College, an all-women's liberal arts college in Massachussets, USA during the Spring semester. I applied to Wellesley through the UIC-exclusive exchange student program. It's a great school with many accomplished alumni, including but certainly not limited to Madeleine Albright and Hillary Clinton.

What made you a decide to stay at Wellesley next semester as well?

> I extended my stay for another semester because I wasn't ready to leave Wellesley just yet. Not only was it an amazing experience to live overseas and build resilience by learning to take care of myself, but the interesting people I met there whom I can now call my friends made Wellesley a second home for me.

> I also feel now that I have gotten the gist of how the school works and what resources are available for its students. I really enjoyed the classes I took at Wellesley and MIT (as a cross-registered student) - the classes weren't necessarily related to my major but touched on my other interests  - and I'm looking forward to taking more major-related courses at Wellesley as well as signing up for classes at Babson College (also via a cross-registration system).

What would be your advice for having a satisfactory time studying abroad? 

> To try new things! Not to stress, but (try to) finesse! Studying abroad is what some consider a standard part of the college experience - it's also a great opportunity to take on new challenges, acquire new interests or develop old ones, and make new connections. I am a firm believer of the quote, "Life begins at the end of your comfort zone" and studying abroad has really helped me step out of my bubble.
