This time we are introducing Mingue Jung who has been working as an RA of Allen House at Songdo International Campus for two semesters.

**What is the most fulfilling memory you have as an RA?**

> I found bonding with my RA colleagues and RC students to be a pure joy. Working together with ten other RAs fostered a strong sense of team spirit in me. Spending time with my RC students offered me the privilege of designing and participating in an incredible freshman year. The most fulfilling moment for me was when I got together with my colleagues and students at the end of the semester and saw that the fond memories I had formed over our time together were shared experiences just as important to them as they were for me.

**Do you have memories of your RC programs you would like to share?**

> The most memorable RC program I organized was called TeaAnyone and it revolved around sharing a cup of tea with our fellow Allenians. That cup of tea was all it took for the initial awkwardness to melt and give way to some great conversations. I stayed in touch with the students who participated in the TeaAnyone program, which helped make the experience all the more special.

**How did your RA work affect your insight of the world?**

> I came to acknowledge in practice rather than theory that there are many different kinds of people in this world with different thoughts and backgrounds. What I consider to be right may not be right for others. This realization led me to cultivate the ability to learn from and encompass various perspectives.
