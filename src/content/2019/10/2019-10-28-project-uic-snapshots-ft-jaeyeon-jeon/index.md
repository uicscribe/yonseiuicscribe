Interview with Jaeyeon Jeon, Comparative Literature and Culture major, Class of 15’

**How does it feel to interact with freshmen at Songdo? **

> While freshmen are not the only students who frequent UIC Writing Center, it is true that they are the majority and I am always happy to be of help to those who haven’t had much experience in academic writing.

**If you are to choose one author that affected your writing, who would that be and why?**

> In Korean, It’s really hard to choose between Han Kang and Hwang Jeong Eun. I think I empathize with Han’s particular manner of shedding light on the questions regarding human existence while Hwang had more impact on the stylistics of my writing. (However, I never related myself to anything as much as I did to Hwang’s short story “누가.”)   
> 
> In English, without a doubt, Virginia Woolf. It’s a mystery how reading her books only gets better each and every time.

**How did your writing center tutor's work affect your insight of the world?**

> Under the premise that I have anything so profound as to be called ‘insight of the world,’ I wonder if 3-hour-long sessions per week could have enough of impact to change how one perceives his surroundings. On a more minute level, however, the tutoring position did change how I understand the overall process of writing. As professor Hong noted on the welcoming page of our website, it ‘can be a solitary act, but it need not be lonely.’
