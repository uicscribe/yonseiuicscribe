Interview with Jewoong Yoon, Energy and Environmental Science and Engineering, Class of 2014

**What do you appreciate most in a friend?**

> I have met various people from different background. But eventually those who enjoyed my sense of humor were the ones who became my best friend. I am thankful for having a good chemistry with them and being able to truly understand each other through jokes.

**What would you consider your biggest flaw?**

> Recently most of the problems that I have are caused by procrastination. I used to finish an assignment a week ahead the due. But now I start the work a day before. I always pledge to myself to start it as soon as possible, but end up struggling at the last minute. It not only affects the quality of my work, but also lowers my confidence.

**What is your idea of happiness?**

> It would be achievements gained through continuous trials. The more desperate you are, the greater happiness your achievements would be. It doesn't have to be something tremendous such as a college entrance exam. Being able to cook a good meal is a great happiness for me. I eventually got a Chef License in Korean and Western Cuisine!
