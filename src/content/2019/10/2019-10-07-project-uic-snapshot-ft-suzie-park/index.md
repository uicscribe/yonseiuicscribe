For this edition of Scribe UIC Snapshots, let me introduce one of the long-time members of UIC film making club Prism X and in general an amazing person Suzie Park.Â 

**If you had watch only one movie forever which one would it be?**

> It's so hard to choose just one movie... But I guess I'll never get sick of watching "Cast Away." I'll cry whenever Tom Hanks calls out for Wilson.

**What place do you like the most on Sinchon campus?**

> My favorite place on campus would be the park benches outside the library. Especially at night, this place gets very quiet and breezy.

**If you could teach any class at UIC what would it be about?**

> I'd love to teach a class about creative writing or screenwriting. It wouldn't really be "teaching" per se. I'd just love to hear what other people have to say and read their stories.
