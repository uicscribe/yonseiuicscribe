Interview with Danny Lee, Economics major, Class of 2017 Fall

**Have you lived or studied abroad? If so, what was your most memorable experience there?**

> I was born in Chile in South America, and I studied there my whole life. I have a lot of good memories from Chile. I went backpacking to Patagonia for a week, and it was amazing. I love nature, and I’ve always been into camping, so doing something like that was really fun. You don’t have to think about anything, you just climb.

**What do you like best about UIC? Do you have favorite subjects so far that you would recommend to underclassmen? **

> When I think about UIC, I don’t think about classes. I think about the campus, the setting. I like the campus because it’s big and spacious. There is a lot of nature and people. That’s why I didn’t like Songdo that much, it’s so empty and industrial-looking.”

> You should take Daryl Bockett’s class. He is the best professor at UIC. He is an International Studies professor. He taught me World History when I was a freshman. He is just a cool guy with a unique sense of humor—it’s funny if you get it.

**If you won the lottery, how would you use it?**

> I would invest in companies, and I would use it to do something nice for my parents.

**If your house was on fire and you could take three things what would they be?**

> My laptop, my camera, and my nintendo switch. If I had a dog, I would take my dog.
