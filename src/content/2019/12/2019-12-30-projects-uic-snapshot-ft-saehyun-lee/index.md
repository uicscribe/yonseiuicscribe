**How was your exchange experience in University of California, Berkeley? What were your most memorable moments?**

> My exchange in Berkeley was a topsy-turvy adventure. It was my first time living abroad, so I had such high expectations of myself. I wanted to make the most of it. With my intellectual curiosity and my goal to go to graduate school, I took a graduate course called “Space, Future, Futurity” in which I  
> acquainted myself with articles across multidisciplinary fields. I also participated in a research apprenticeship program in a sociology lab, executing interview analysis on international marriages. Both experiences deepened my knowledge on the dynamics of ethnicity, sexuality, and identity in modern society, and enabled me to grasp what I anticipate studying later in my graduate years.

**I know that you engaged in the internship program at the Woodrow Wilson Center for three months. How was the internship?**

> During mid-May to mid-August, I worked as a research assistant (scholar intern) for Jean Lee at the Woodrow Wilson Center. During the 3-month internship, the main task that I did was analyzing North Korean literary and cultural materials, which my supervisor was going to use for her study. I also got to monitor news on North Korea’s nuclear/international policies, organize different forums that are held in the center. Overall, it was an insightful experience as I got to learn more about how a think tank works  
> and its role in international politics.

**What are your major plans for 2020?**

> During my exchange, I was able to reflect my goal of communicating social problems through using media. I believe I can make 2020 a year to further deepen this goal and to hone my skills to dive into the real world.
