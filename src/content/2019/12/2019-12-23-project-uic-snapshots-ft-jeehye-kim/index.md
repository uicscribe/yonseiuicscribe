Interview with Jeehye Kim, Economics major Class of 2018

**What is your favorite book?**

> _The Catcher in the Rye_ by J.D Salinger. It touched me very deeply because I read it towards the end of my high school senior year, when the coming of age narrative lined up with what was going on in my life.

**What is your most memorable travel experience?**

> When I went on a cruise to the Caribbean with my family last year. I went horseback riding on the beach in Playa del Carmen in Mexico and went swimming into the ocean with stingrays!

**What class you took this semester would you recommend to your friends?**

> My favorite class this semester was Professor Hong’s seminar class on ‘History and Fiction’. We read fascinating books in class, and I had the opportunity to listen to how others interpreted the text, which is a privilege you can’t have when you’re reading by yourself.
