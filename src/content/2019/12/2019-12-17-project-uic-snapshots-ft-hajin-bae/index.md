Interview with Hajin Bae, Creative Technology Management student, class of 2016

**What has been your favorite CTM major course so far?**

> I really enjoyed taking Professor Shin Cho’s Economics of Technological Innovation. The course covered the fundamentals of economics, as well as some topics pertaining to technology and innovation. Of course, it was far from easy. Two of my friends and I would make self-deprecating jokes about how we were like Magnemites that combine their brains as they link together but don’t get any smarter. My special thanks to Se Jeen and Ahyoung. Couldn’t have made it without you.

**Are you a cat person or a dog person?**

> I am definitely a dog person. I like people who like me back, and I guess that just goes the same for animals too. Dogs usually like me more than cats do and that is why I prefer dogs to cats. It’s as simple as that. I do, however, always have an unrequited love for cats. Maybe one day I’ll find a cat that would love me back and from that day on I might become a cat person. 

**What’s the most recent movie you watched?**

> I watched Frozen 2 last week, and I absolutely loved it. The soundtrack was amazing, and I fell for Elsa (again). I told my mom how I wanted to grow up to be Elsa, and she reminded me that I was turning 24 next month but I don’t care. Nothing can stop my love for her.
