Junsung Lee, Entering Class of 18, Nano Science and Engineering

**What is the most memorable house event you have hosted as a RA?**

> The most memorable event would be the Zeller’s Pub I hosted this semester. Students talked to each other while having good food and enjoying the live soccer match. I was inspired from the English pubs and I think it turned out pretty awesome! The best part of being an Appenzeller RA is that your fellow RAs are always willing to lend a hand as if it were their event. If it weren’t for my fellow RAs, I wouldn’t have been able to manage the event.”

**What do you cherish the most about being the coach for the RC soccer team?**

> Since RC Olympics is based on voluntary participation, players could have been less motivated to devote their fullest effort. However, our players attended all the regular practices and even underwent additional training on their own. Although we were not the champions, we played as one and I can assure anyone that our players had the tightest bonds, which is what this RC education ultimately meant for.

**If you could have lunch with anyone in the world, who would that be?**

> I believe this is the trickiest question… If I had to choose one, it would be the whole Liverpool squad. As a huge fan, it would be the most unforgettable lunch. Furthermore, I wish the Liverpool manager, Jürgen Klopp, would slip me some of his secret tips, and becoming the champion next semester surely would be a breeze(laughs).
