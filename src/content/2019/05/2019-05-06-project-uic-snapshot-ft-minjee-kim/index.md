This week's interviewee is Minjee Kim from the LSBT class of 18.

**How are you enjoying sinchon campus life? Do you have a favorite class?**

> I’m having fun a lot. I love places where I can have tasty foods around campus. On the academic side, I like that there are more interesting classes compared to songdo campus. Fortunately, I’m enjoying most of my classes for this semester but if I have to choose one, I would say ‘Introduction to Modern Biological Science and Research’. It’s interesting to know how biological researches are going on these days.  

**Are you in any clubs right now? Can you tell us more about it?**

> I’m in the club ‘EagleEagle’. It’s a bowling club and we play games once a week. At first, I didn’t even know there is such kind of club but thanks to one of my friends who introduced me this club, I joined and knew how much playing games with nice people gives me great joy.  

**If you could describe yourself as a dessert, what would you be?**

> It’s more like a dessert that I want to be than that describes myself, but I want to be a person like strawberry ice cream. It is one of my favorite desserts so it came into my mind first, and I believe that there are not many people who hate it. So I want to be a person who can spread happy vibes to people around me.
