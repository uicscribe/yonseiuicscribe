Interview with Alisa Sunmark â€“ Econ Class of 16

**What do you like best about UIC?**

> One of the best things in UIC is diversity. What I mean by this is how faculty in UIC as a whole, not only students, but including professors came from different cultures, countries, and have different mother tongue. However, we all share the common medium language, which is English, and the passion of learning.

**Who is your favorite professor?**

> It is very difficult to say who my favorite professor is, because all of the professors in UIC are very high educated and are very proficient in his or her areas of teaching. However, if I really have to choose one, I would say Professor Helen Lee. She is currently teaching me World Literature (Jap. Lit), and I really enjoy attending her class. She did not only teaches us what was appeared in the text, but she allows us to have our own original ideas and never limit our thinking. This is the true meaning of the true liberal arts education.

**If you could have a superpower, what would it be?**

> If I have one superpower, I would like to have the ability to make people happy all the time. I would like to help people who suffers from depression, anxiety, and etc. With this ability, I can help them to have a better live. I really do hope that everyone can always smile and laugh happily throughout their lives.
