For this week’s snapshot, we feature Ye Won Choi, UD class of 17, currently majoring in Economics.

**What is your all-time favorite memory in school since you’ve started college?**

> My favorite memory in college was taking part in the 2017 Yeon-Ko games as a member of Blue Knights. Cheering for our school, especially when we won all 5 games, is something that I can never forget!

**Have you been part of any club activities? How did you manage your time between school work and extracurricular activities?**

> I participated in many extracurricular activities because I thought they were as important as school work. So I must confess that I didn't put in that much effort into my studies.

**How do you like to relax and decompress?**

> Nobody hates sweets, right? I love looking for new dessert cafes and sweet things to eat! So far, my favorites are ice cream waffle, tiramisu cake, and macaron.
