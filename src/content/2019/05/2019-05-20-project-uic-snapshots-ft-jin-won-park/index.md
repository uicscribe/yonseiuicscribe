Interview with Jin Won Park, Econ, Class of 2018

**Where are you going for an exchange student program? How long are you studying abroad?**

> I am going to Durham University in the United Kingdom for an academic year.

**Why did you apply for an exchange student program?**

> I believe that an exchange student program is a special opportunity that only college students can experience. I thought it would give me more time to focus on myself because of less pressure on getting good grades. Also, I wanted to improve my academic English and learn new topics that are not deeply studied in Korea such as Brexit and EU. I wish to learn how international organizations are structured and how they benefit society.

**What are you most looking forward to?**

> I am looking forward to RC programs because RC is a big part of Durham as it was one of the pioneer schools of RC programs. I want to fully immerse myself in the community. I am also looking forward to extracurricular activities and clubs such as sports and music. In addition to on-campus activities, I am excited about vacation because I want to travel a lot in Europe.
