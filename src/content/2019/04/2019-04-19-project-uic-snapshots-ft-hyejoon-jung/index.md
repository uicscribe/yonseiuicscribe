This time we are introducing last year's captain of homeroom 9, Hyejoon Jung.

**What is the happiest memory you have from being homeroom captain?**

> I think my genuine affection toward homeroom 9 comes from the relationships with the underclassmen, witnessing their enthusiasm and love for university life.  

**Do you have other memories of your homeroom you would like to share?**

> I recently found a random box full of nametags from the pre-frosh workshop that brought back memories of last year. I meant to put them away since they were no longer used any more, but I thought they were valuable pieces of memory that are worth remembering.  

**How did this influence your insight of the world?**

> First, I thought it was really hard to sustain a deep, long-lasting friendships in college, since there are so many people in school, all different and busy in their own ways. But I realized that among numerous encounters, you can always find those who appreciate and remember you. I want to cherish the moments I have with the people around me and do my best. Even though you might not notice right afterwards, they might also feel the good heart you want to share with them.
