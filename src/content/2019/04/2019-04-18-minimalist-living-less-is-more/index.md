Let’s face it, most people believe money can buy happiness. I mean don’t we all love using money to reward ourselves with material items? Whenever we finish our duties or fulfill our goals, we tend to go search for new clothes, jewelry, expensive meals, or even plane tickets to vacation spots. We spend money on these material goods to taste the pleasure of accomplishment, for that moment of happiness when you feel like you spent your money on something you deserve.

We live in a world driven by consumerism. Every day when we turn on the television or access social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram on our smart phones, we are exposed to commercials and posts that trigger our desire to consume. Take the thriving home shopping market in Korea as an example. According to Euromonitor, a global market research company, the industry has shown a rapid growth of 53 percent since 2012. With an average of 100,000 transactions each day, these home shopping channels have over 30 million household views annually. In fact, consciously or unconsciously, we often purchase goods, whether it be food, clothing, cosmetics, or accessories, that we don’t necessarily need. The media tricks us into believing we can achieve happiness by acquiring more and that we would feel left out if we don’t follow the latest trends. We become trapped in an endless cycle: We can’t stop surrounding ourselves with all the _stuff_.  

Minimalism is a lifestyle we can adopt to resist our urges to consume and to break free from the consumerism trap. We have to constantly remind ourselves that more doesn’t mean better. Once you try it, you would be surprised of how little you actually need to survive.The Minimalists, American authors Joshua Fields Millburna and Ryan Nicodemus, say _“Minimalism is a tool that can assist you in finding freedom. Freedom from fear. Freedom from worry. Freedom from overwhelm. Freedom from guilt. Freedom from depression. Freedom from the trappings of the consumer culture we’ve built our lives around. Real freedom.”_

#### **How to Become a Minimalist**

- **Ask Yourself Important Questions Before You Take Any Action**

In what ways would my life become better by having less? What will happen when my complex life is simplified? What does simplifying _mean_ for me?  

It is important to acknowledge that embracing minimalism does not bring about the same benefits for everybody. The benefits are different for each individual even though the methods of simplification may be alike.  

- **Write it Down: Set a Goal for Yourself**

Rather than simply stating “I am going to become a minimalist”, it is more realistic to set a specific goal (ex. I am going to wear only thirty-three items of clothing for the following three months) and write about _why_ you want to carry out a simple lifestyle and _how_ you are going to achieve that goal. You can organize your thoughts on paper and look at the notes later on to constantly remind yourself why living more simply matters to you.

- **Start Small**

You won’t have any momentum when you first start. You need it to build up over time. So, don’t force yourself to make radical changes. Start with one item at a time. Try getting rid of one item each day for two weeks and see what happens. Or you can start with your desk or closet. Get rid of unnecessary items that you have not used for a while. It can even be items that simply do not bring you joy. Discard the duplicates. De-clutter the area and make more space. A significant amount of stress will be removed by simply reducing the number of items.

- **Constantly Question Your Possessions**

Do I really need this? Am I going to miss the item if it is out of my sight? What would happen if I gave it away to another person? Will other people make more use of the item than me?

#### **Benefits of Minimalist Living**

There are some practical benefits that you can acquire if you become a minimalist. By letting go of dispensable items, it will be easier to clean your house. You will be presented with more visually appealing space that will enable you to enhance your peace of mind. You no longer have to get stressed out looking at the piles of clutter. By restricting yourself from purchasing unnecessary items, you will be able to save money by spending less. This will eventually help the environment as you will produce less waste in the future.
