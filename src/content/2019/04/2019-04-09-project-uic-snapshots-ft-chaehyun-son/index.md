This week’s piece features Chaehyun Son from the class of 19, majoring in Asian Studies. She is currently an active member of the Korean YouTube channel “YonKo TV”- best known for its video contents offering a sneak peek at the life in Korean universities, mainly Yonsei and Korea. She is participating under the nickname “Hana”.  

**How and when did you discover about YonKo TV and what was the motivation behind pursuing a place at the channel?**

> I first came across this channel in my junior year of high school. Since then, I often watched their videos to gain motivation and access various helpful information as I prepared to apply for university. Since I aspire to find a job in broadcasting in future, I applied straight away when my favorite channel posted a recruiting notice after the college entrance exam.  

**Among the dozens of projects the channel has worked on, which project do you personally find the most interesting?**

> The interviews are always the most memorable for me. As an interviewer, you get to meet new people and can lead the atmosphere of the set to the interviewee’s needs. As an interviewee, I was thrilled to share my experience with students all across Korea, who may be struggling with their studies for college entrance exam. In fact, I was filled with emotions while preparing for interviews, being reminiscent of my own stumbles.  

**What is the most meaningful part of the experience and why?**

> First, I get to participate in the actual process of video production. As I aspire to be an announcer, the experience lets me practice in a professional setting. Second, it is always worthwhile to provide guidance to middle and high school students, both on social media and in person. Not only is it rewarding, it also motivates me to work harder. Lastly, I am always delighted with the people I meet, especially my fellow Yonko TV crew members, whom never fail to inspire me for further growth.
