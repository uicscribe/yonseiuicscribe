**What is your favorite course you are taking this semester and why?**  

> My favorite course is life writing. I like how this class teaches us to write, it’s all about writing freely. There is a lot of work, but because I like it, I am okay with taking this course.  

**What do you do when you’re stressed out?  
**

> I listen to music, either rap music or I really like Lana Del Ray. I also will sleep or eat. Though these don’t really solve the problem, so I tend to be stressed out all the time.  

**If you were a food what would you be and why?  
**

> Chocolate cake, because like chocolate it is sweet, but also can be bitter. Also its addicting but can be over powering and too much if you eat a lot of it… yeah that’s me.
