This week’s piece features Jaeho Jung, from the Class of 15, majoring in Economics.  

**What has been your favourite course so far this semester?**

> Leadership Workshop.  The course invites various leaders of different industries to give lectures about leadership.  The most recent lecture invited the current CEO of Hermes Korea where he lectured about planning a global career.  It was a very interesting and instructive lecture. Also, since the course is 3-credit pass or fail course, we can listen to the lecture without having to worry about letter grades.  

**What do you do in order to de-stress during the course of a semester?**

> I participate in weekly workout sessions as a member of Yonsei CrossFit club KWANG.  It’s physically demanding from time to time, but it surely takes my mind off from academic pressures.  And the food we eat after the workout sessions are amazing as well.  

**What do you plan to do now that the weather seems to be softening?**

> This year is probably my last year as a college student (well, hopefully).  I’m thinking about going around the campus and Sinchon with my friends and drink coffee to leave lasting memories of college.
