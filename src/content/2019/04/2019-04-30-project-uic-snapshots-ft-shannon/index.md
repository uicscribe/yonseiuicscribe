This time we are introducing the current Life Science and Biotechnology Student Council Representative - Shannon, finishing her fourth semester at UIC.

 **What is your favorite place in Korea?**

> Goyang. It’s not as busy as Seoul but still not too far away. It has hangout vibes like Hongdae but nowhere near as many people. Plus, the Flower Festival there is really awesome.  

**What was the weirdest/funniest question you have ever been asked in Korea?**

> I have been asked at least three times “Why do your glasses make your eyes look so big?”. Mostly these were people from UIC actually. I guess it’s because my glass lenses are made the opposite way compared to Korean standard. I’m long-sighted which I believe is uncommon here.  

**If you could become a professor for a day, which class would you like to teach?**

> I don’t think I have a specific class, to be honest I would probably teach any of the sports or dance classes. I’m just a tad bit addicted to sport and dance. Other than that I’d could see myself being the Appenzeller RM since I could participate in all those fun events, eat great
