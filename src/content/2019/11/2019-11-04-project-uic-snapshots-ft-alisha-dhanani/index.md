Interview with Alisha Dhanani, Political Science and International Relations major, Class of 2018

**What’s one thing you learned from attending Yonsei?**

> Through learning Korean at school and speaking to locals, I’ve learned that Korean elders and older Korean ladies are especially nice and respectful. They helped me out when I first arrived in Korea, with settling down and adjusting to a new environment.

**How would you describe your ideal life?**

> Generally speaking, I would want to live a comfortable life, where I have financial stability. I would also want to work at an NGO where I can help people in war-torn places, by educating them or assisting in building shelters. 

**What do you like about majoring in Political Science & International Relations at Yonsei?**

> I like the range of content that’s covered in these classes, whether it’s on nationalism or on East Asian security. It’s a nice way of being updated on political issues, and I learn to be more empathetic by learning how other people’s countries and systems are working. But I do think this major can benefit from hiring more professors, especially those who can speak English fluently. It would also be nice if the school opens up more classes for this major, since there are currently 7 classes in total.
