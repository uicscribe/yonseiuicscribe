Interview with Hasub Park, Political Science and International Relations student, entering class of fall 2017. 

**What made you take a break from UIC?**

> The biggest motivation for me to take a break from UIC was so that I could help my parents' organization. Since I am going to the military in 2020, I wanted to do something for my parents.

**What do you miss most from school?**

> Definitely my friends. Being able to make beautiful memories with your friends and family is the absolute best way to spend time. After I return from the military, all my friends will have graduated, but I will do my best to maintain my relationships beyond the environment of UIC.

**Would you recommend other students to take a leave of absence?**

> I think I learned every day how to value personal relationships, love, and trust between people instead of solely focusing on my career and maximizing utility for every action I take. Some experiences don't necessarily boost my resume, and that's ultimately still okay. So, I would recommend taking a leave of absence, even if it is for simply healing your own body and mind.
