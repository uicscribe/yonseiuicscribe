**How is Sinchon life so far? Is there a big difference between Sinchon and Songdo? **

> Sinchon life is treating me well so far. Because I completed a lot of my Common Curriculum courses in Songdo, the big difference between Sinchon and Songdo life for me is that I have the liberty to take more courses from other colleges in Yonsei. For example, last semester I took a Korean-taught lectures on Latin American society and culture and Interpersonal Psychology. I also think that Sinchon has more fun and more places to visit than Songdo. 

**Are you in any student clubs? If so, please tell us more about it. **

> During freshman year I was a part of Yonsei Delegation of Model United Nations (YDMUN) and Underwood Vision Ensemble (UVE). Currently, I’m part of the Yonsei Association of International Politics (연세대학교 국제정치학회), which is an academic association under the College of Social Science. It is my first time joining an academic association and although it took time to get to know the people, it’s an interesting experience to discuss and analyze current events in international politics and learn new international political theory. 

**What’s your plan for the winter break? **

> Starting from next January, I’m going on an exchange to McGill University in Canada for a semester. So, during the couple of weeks I have left in Korea, I plan on completing my last minute preparations for exchange and meet up with my cherished friends before I leave to Canada for almost half a year.
