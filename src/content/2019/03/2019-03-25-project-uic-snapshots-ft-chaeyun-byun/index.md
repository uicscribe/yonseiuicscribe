This week’s piece features Chaeyun Byun, from the class of 18, majoring in CLC.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of being a Sinchon newbie?

> The advantages of being a Sinchon newbie is that everything feels new, and school is exciting. There are many events nearby happening around me and I get to see lots of new people. One disadvantage is that compared to Songdo, all the classes are so far away. Hopefully I’ll soon get used to our bigger campus.

What is a piece of music you are fond of right now?

> I recently started listening to an old Korean band called Dongmulwon (동물원). Although it isn't autumn yet, I would like to recommend “Writing A Letter on a Cloudy Autumn Sky” (흐린 가을 하늘에 편지를 써) because of its beautiful sentimental lyrics.

What club (동아리) are you currently participating in?

> I’m currently in the UIC film club Prism X. We write our own scenarios, act, film, edit, and upload the finished films onto our Youtube channel. I was motivated to join this club because I’ve always wanted to do something creative, and film was something I’ve never tried before.
