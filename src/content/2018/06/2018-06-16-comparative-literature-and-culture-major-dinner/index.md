**About the Comparative Literature and Culture Major**

The Comparative Literature and Culture Major (CLC) hosts some of UIC’s most creative and critical minds. Students are exposed to works of different literary traditions, critical theory, film, and popular culture. Some popular courses of the major include: Rock Music and American Identity, Readings in Medieval European Literature, and Postcolonial Literature in English. The flexible and interdisciplinary program allows students to cultivate a well-rounded and critical understanding of the world around them.

On June 1st, 2018, the CLC Major hosted a special dinner for their students and professors. This semester, the dinner was held in Sinchon’s famous Italian restaurant, Team Nolita. The biannual Major Dinner is a time for both students and professors to relax outside of class and enjoy some pleasant conversation and great food. The event invited major, minor, and even prospective CLC students.

The dinner was held in a private are of the restaurant. Around 7pm, students and professors started filing in. We exchanged greetings and took our seats. Some of us chose to sit with some close friends or with professors whose classes we were taking this semester. The more adventurous students sat with others whom they had never met before.

This year’s major representative and vice-representative, Tessa (CLC 16) and Ji Hyun (CLC 16), informed us that the chair professor would not be able to attend the event. Nonetheless, the representatives gave us a warm welcome and delivered some heartfelt words about the CLC community.

The menu included dishes such as margherita pizza, carbonara pasta, caprese salad, and many more. The amazing selection of dishes delighted everyone. Students and teachers could not refrain from making jokes about how elegant and luxurious our major dinner seemed compared to the other dinners they had attended. Everything was within budget, of course.

The restaurant’s intimate and warm atmosphere made a great place for conversation. Some students left early, but a number of students and professors stayed back. We were enjoying our conversation so much we lost track of time. It was great to meet our peers and professors outside the typical classroom setting and talk about our different academic interests, hobbies, personal experiences, and even goals for the future. The CLC Major Dinner was a great success and it certainly helped all of us feel like part of a community.

How would you describe the Comparative Literature and Culture (CLC) community?

Tessa (CLC Representative): One way to describe the CLC community would be “diverse.” We are very diverse, we all come from different backgrounds, and we are very international too. We have a lot of new international students coming in. It can be said that we are also very inclusive. Also, when it comes to diversity, it extends to the classes that CLC offers. We have classes ranging from music to literature, such as Medieval Literature, Renaissance Literature, but there are also classes like The Culture and Literature of Dreams, and Myth and Counterculture. CLC, to put it in one word, is diverse.

Ji Hyun (CLC Vice-Representative): It is like a big family. It is a diverse family of different people, but at the same time we are also really tightly knit. So for events like the dinner it is really great to gather people around and strengthen our bonds. We also get to listen to their different stories, like where they are from, or how they used to live. We really get to know all their different cultures. As you know CLC is also related to cultural studies.

Why do you think it is important to have events like the CLC Major Dinner?

Tessa: The reason why we are having this event is to have the CLC students grow closer. That includes people who are minoring, double majoring, and also freshmen who are prospective CLC students. They get to know their seniors and also the professors. Personally, I feel that communication and connection within the CLC community, especially since we are a small major, is also very important and vital.
