### Now, that the semester is halfway done, what is one thing you want to do before the semester ends?

> Finish my readings before the finals!

### What is your favorite and least favorite thing about the weather getting colder?

> My favorite part about fall is to watch all the green leaves turn red, yellow and orange. My least favorite part is having to wear multiple layers of clothes.

### What is your favorite song to listen to in fall, and why?

> "September" by Earth, Wind & Fire is my go to song for fall! It’s an old song but it's also an easy-to-groove song with chill vibes.
