Writing and reading are indispensable skills for university students, especially for students at Underwood International College (UIC). The burdensome weekly assignments which require continuous writing in English is indeed an unavoidable part of UIC life that all students must grow accustomed to. Including but not limited to Common Curriculum courses such as _Freshman Writing Intensive Seminar_ that UIC freshmen are advised to take, UIC students are constantly exposed to various texts and writing assignments to hone their writing and reading skills. To help students out in creating analytic and intelligent pieces of writing while enhancing clarity and improving the effectiveness of their writing, the UIC Writing Center reaches out to students with open arms.

#### **How does the program work?**

The UIC Writing Center is an individual tutor-tutee system that is open to students from Monday to Thursday (Monday 12:00-3:00 pm, Tuesday 1:00-4:00 pm, Wednesday 4:00-7:00 pm, Thursday 2:00-5:00 pm). The UIC Writing Center was newly launched this semester at the Songdo International Campus, and any UIC student, from freshmen to upperclassmen, are welcome to visit and get tutoring sessions free of charge.

Students can make an online reservation by providing their name, major, email address and cell phone number through the website: [https://uic.yonsei.ac.kr/writingcenter/default.asp](https://uic.yonsei.ac.kr/writingcenter/default.asp) to talk with trained tutors of their choice, who are selected by the faculty. Visiting students are responsible for bringing their outlines, assignment, and questions for substantive help and the tutors will provide suggestions for their tutees in brainstorming, structuring and developing ideas in the student’s writing.

After scheduling a reservation online, students will have a 30-minute individual feedback session with their tutor. Students can make up to two appointment sessions per week and to cancel the appointment, they must cancel at least twelve hours before the scheduled time to avoid any penalty. Not showing up for an appointment without prior cancellation three times will prohibit the students from utilizing resources at the Writing Center for the entire semester. Students may freely walk into the Writing Center and receive help when there are no other reservations at that time.

#### **B****rief Interview with a UIC Writing Center Tutor and Tutee**

Sooyeon is a tutor who works at the UIC Writing Center at the Songdo International Campus. When asked about the reasons why students normally visit the writing center, Sooyeon replied that there were various reasons, distinctive to each student.

“Various students in various stages of writing come to the center,” she replied. “Some students visit to understand their prompts or edit their drafts. Some students come with their finished essays to go over them together with the tutors.”

For students to make the best use of the UIC Writing Center, Sooyeon advises “not to be afraid to come at any stage of writing.” Sooyeon added that if students bring a completed essay, the tutors could help them out more.

“We cannot proofread and we do not necessarily fix grammatical mistakes. However, the writing center is ready to help students at any stage of writing and it is easier to visit us than the professors with an outline for your writing.”

During a brief Interview with a UIC Writing Center tutee, Soohyun, she was asked about what motivated her to make an appointment at the UIC Writing Center. According to Soohyun, she is taking the _Freshman Writing Intensive Seminar_ (FWIS) course this semester. She said that she decided to schedule a meeting to gain more confidence in writing. It was her FWIS professor who had introduced her to this program. Soohyun added that she likes the fact that the writing center is “absolutely free.”

“Friendly tutors helped me not only with the assignments but also gave me tips for the class in general. The tutors cannot edit or complete the essay for students. However, they provide students with useful ideas to enhance their writing skills. Tutees should be prepared with some structured outlines and thoughts ahead of the meeting.” She also added that although she struggled to find available hours for the appointment online, she plans to visit the writing center again.

The UIC Writing Center can be found at the Veritas B Hall #421-1 on the Songdo International Campus. To sign up for an individual appointment, visit the UIC Writing Center’s website, and schedule a meeting online to meet available tutors.
