_![](./images/SCRIBE-LOGO-300x300.png)“UIC Snapshots” is a series of short Q&A sessions with people connected to Underwood International College. The aim of this mini-series is to show snapshots of UIC itself and the lives of those who are a part of it._

_This week’s piece features KT: a UIC student from the Class of 15.5 majoring in Asian Studies._

 

### _What are some of your favorite classes/ professors? Why?_

> I would have to say my favorite professors and classes are the most difficult ones, the kind that really makes you think.  It might sound strange, but classes that make me feel extremely stupid are my favorite because it means that I am learning!
> 
> There’s nothing I love more than being intellectually shut down by a professor, (cough Professor Hong cough) because it both humbles me by reminding me to check my blind youthful arrogance and opens me up to new perspectives and ways of thinking about things. I think it’s a hard pill for some people to swallow, especially in a college as competitive as ours, but I’d much rather not get that ‘A’ if I come out of a course with learning more or wanting to learn more.  I really don’t think that the benefits of challenging yourself academically and intellectually are reflected or quantifiable by a letter grade.

 

### _What kind of music do you like to study to?_

> Depending on what I’m studying or the type of assignment I’m working on, the music will change.  If I’m casually studying, either “lofi hip-hop” or “vaporwave” and/or 1980s Japanese pop music. Sometimes I’ll jam to some 1920-40s big band swing jazz.  But if it’s a ten-page essay and I’m in intense panic mode, you know I’ll be blasting DJ Solo’s Traps n Trees 1~3 mixes.

 

### _If you could describe the state of your student life in two colors, what would they be?_

> This is an odd question, and I’m not quite sure how to answer!  I would consider myself pastel colors or whatever color my hair is at a given time, but for my “student life”?  I suppose dark green and grey? Not sure why, but those two colors come to mind.
