This week’s piece features Hee Young: a UIC student from the class of '15, majoring in Economics.

 

### _We’re here today at a CrossFit Box. Could you briefly introduce to us what CrossFit is and what its benefits are?_

 

> So, CrossFit is a sport that is basically a mix of various disciplines like weightlifting, aerobics and calisthenics. It’s very good for building strength because it focuses on so much functional movement, but it’s also good for conditioning because so many of the workouts are HIIT (high intensity interval training). It’s also really good for people new to working out because there are so many people motivating each other to strive harder throughout the workouts.

### _CrossFit sounds really great, but isn’t it challenging to balance maintaining such an intense workout regimen along with your schoolwork?_

 

> I don't think maintaining or enhancing your body is something that is detrimental to studying. I think, if anything, it enhances your studying potential. No one can sit on the chair all day studying; it’s impossible! I believe through CrossFit, I can build my stamina and be able to focus more on my academics.

 

### _We have the midterm exams coming up next week. Any advice on how to ace the exams?_

 

> I don’t have a golden formula, but I think setting specific rest periods is helpful. And an adequate amount too! If you set specific periods to rest, you won’t have the problem of resting too much or too little so I think that will help with managing your time and fatigue efficiently when preparing for exams.
