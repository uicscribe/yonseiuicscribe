This weekâ€™s piece features Klaudia: a UIC student from the Class of 16.5, majoring in PSIR.

### Who is your favorite UIC professor and why?

> Dennis Lee, because he actually tries to engage with the students and goes out of his way to help them. He makes sure you stay on the right track for class. And I think he really listens to the students, too. And his classes are fun and not stressful, but you still learn stuff.

### What are some small things that make your day better?

> When the cab I take to school takes the shorter route. And when I joke around with my friends.

### What is your most-used emoji?

> The one that looks like it's low-key in pain (ðŸ˜«), but then I use it because it can express many different things. Like, for example, if my favorite celebrity posts a really, really hot photo, then it can represent my frustration on how good-looking he is, and how much I love that person. And, letâ€™s say itâ€™s finals week, and I have 5 examsÂ back-to-back, but my friend asks me to go out. I can send that emoji and be like, â€œI wanna go out, but I canâ€™t, ðŸ˜« and Iâ€™m really, really upset about it."
