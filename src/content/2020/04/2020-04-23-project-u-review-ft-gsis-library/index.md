### **Good**

- The Graduate School of International Studies (GSIS) library is located on the third floor of the New Millennium Hall (NMH). If you are an Underwood International College student, and especially an International Studies major, you will inevitably take some courses in this building. The library is a great spot to study and get assignments done in your “gongang” or free time in between classes, but also if you simply need to take a power nap.

- The GSIS library has printing facilities and a spacious study room area with rectangle tables for 6 people each. It’s a decent substitute to the Daewoo Annex Hall student rooms or the Central Library, which are crowded most of the time. 
- If you are hungry, there’s no need to go to the cafeteria in Daewoo or the Student Union building down the hill. It can quickly drop by the basement floor of NMH. Here you will find a variety of menus to choose from, including Korean, Western, Vietnamese food, and even burritos. You can sneak in food in the library as long as you eat quietly.

### **Meh**

- If you are coming directly from Yonsei’s main entrance, unless you take the shuttle bus, this place is too far.
- Although the study room remains open until 10pm, the library itself closes at 6pm. 
- You may occasionally encounter disrespectful students who put their earphones on maximum volume or do team projects really loudly.
