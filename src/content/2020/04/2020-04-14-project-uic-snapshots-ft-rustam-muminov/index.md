Interview with Rustam Muminov, Economics major class of 2019

**Where was your favorite place you traveled to or lived in?**

South Korea, because I’ve only lived in Uzbekistan and Russia. Both of the countries are not bad but South Korea feels more like home. It is safe here; people do not judge your outer looks as much and are more open to different styles. I am personally really into fashion, which is why I find it amazing when the majority of the people around me are stylish and like my personal style as well.

**How do you manage an active lifestyle?**

Before Corona hit, I would always find some time to go out of my dorm room with a couple of friends to hang around with. If everyone was busy, I would try to hit the gym or even work out in my own room just to keep myself busy.

**What is your favorite video game of all time?**

This is a tough one… Probably would have to say Star Wars the Old Republic (SWTOR) as I am a huge fan of the Star Wars Universe. I read the majority of the books, watched all the movies and series, and just genuinely love the universe that George Lucas has created. Being able to be a part of it really does make a Star Wars fan a happy man.
