**What was the most dangerous moment in your life?**

When I lived in Italy, there were a couple bees in the house at one point even when the windows were closed. It was starting to concern me until one day when I opened the bathroom door, there were over 30 bees flying around! I immediately closed the door and my dad had to take care of them using bug spray.

**What movie character(s) would you like to be?**

I would like to be the magicians in Now You See Me. The scenes where the characters used tricks and illusions were really cool to see and I feel like I could control the world if I can use magic! That would be very enjoyable.

**What did you look forward to in university, and what did you actually do?**

I wanted to enjoy a big birthday party, go to Akaraka, and do an all-clear during course registration. Out of these I got a ticket for Akaraka, but I just had a small party for my birthday since it was a day before the new semester. I also had to do add and drop each semester, so all-clear did not go well either.
