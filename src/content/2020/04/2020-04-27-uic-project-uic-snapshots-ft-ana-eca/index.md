Interview with Ana Eça, Asian Studies and Political Science major, class of fall 2017.

**Tell us about your favorite class at UIC so far.**

My favourite class has been Studies in American Literature by Professor Kelly Walsh. I am really interested in cultural awareness and equality issues and this class focused on racist issues in America.

**What is your favorite thing to do in the Sinchon area?**

I love running errands in Sinchon because it feels like home. I always end up seeing someone I know and it feels really small in comparison to Hongdae, for example. I definitely love grabbing 찌개 (Korean stew dish) and 돌솥비빔밥 (Hot bowl bibimbap) too. Great restaurants.

**What has changed for you since the outbreak of COVID19, as an international student?**

I have learnt that my situation as an international student is taken more into consideration by the UIC board than I thought it did. I am stuck in my home country due to this situation and everyone has been thoughtful and mindful of that.
