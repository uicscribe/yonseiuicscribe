Finding food, let alone a meal, to eat during the narrow break students have in between classes is a challenge on its own. Especially in Yonsei University’s Sinchon Campus where the faculties and the affordable restaurants are located far away from each other. Students will need to calculate the distance, the taste of the meal, the cost of the meal, whom to eat with, and most importantly, how long it will take to travel andeat. It's a lot of thinking, but fret no more. The following are a list of restaurants and cafeterias where students can enjoy a big, tasty, healthy meal at a reasonable price within a short amount of time.

### 1\. Gyujigwon Cafeteria (한경관, 교직원 식당) 1st floor

Located in a small but spacious and warm building of Hangyeong Hall, the Gyujigwon cafeteria provides several full-course korean meals, including soup and non-soup food that only costs 6500 won. It is a perfect cafeteria that fits a university student’s budget and stomach, and it is frequented by not only students but also by professors, too. 

One drawback of Gyujigwon is the fact that it only opens between 12:00 - 14:00 and that it has a fixed food plan per day. In other words, they provide one type of meal on Mondays, but provides another type on Tuesdays, and so on. 

But due to its good taste, cheap price, big and fast serving, and proximity to the Yeonhui, Daewoo Annex, and Daebyol in general, it’s a perfect place for UIC students to visit during their lunch breaks. 

Recommended meal: They serve different type of meal everyday.

### 2\. Student Union Building, 1F cafeteria

This is another Korean food cafeteria located on the 1st floor of the Student Union building. It works between 7:00 to 9:00 for breakfast, from 11:00 to 14:00 for lunch, from 16:00 to 17:00 for dinner on weekdays, and is closed on Saturdays and Sundays. The price often varies between 2500 won (breakfast) to 6500 won and students are provided with a full korean meal which is enough to fill anyone’s stomach.

Personally, I think the breakfast meals are the best here, and not many students show up during breakfast period, so you can enjoy your meal in relative peace. However, the lunch period and the dinner period are very busy as it is always full with students and faculty members.

The cafeteria also offers snack choices such as ramen, kimbap, and a cafe is located right next to it, on the same floor. 

Recommended food: Breakfast (2500 won)

### 3\. Sinseon Seolnongtang (신선 설농탕)

“Sinseon Seolnongtang” is a 24 hours restaurant located just outside of Yonsei’s Sinchon Campus in the street where Daiso and No brand is located. It is a clean-looking, white glass building that offers variety of seolnongtang or, in english, the ox bone soup, and other korean meals such as bulgogi and kimchi pancake.

Due to its location outside of campus, its price is slightly more expensive than the campus food, ranging from 8000 won to 21000 won. However, for students and faculty members, they can eat a healthy and full meal with 8000 won. Also, the staff of the restaurant are quite clean and welcoming. 

Recommended meal: Seolnongtang medium (8000 won)

### 4\. Delicious steamed tofu and kimchi (맛있는 순두부앤김치찜)

This exceptionally long-named 24-hours restaurant is located a few blocks down from the Seolnungtang restaurant mentioned above. It is a busy restaurant with mostly foreign customers coming in and out of the restaurant. The staff there are always the same, two women who serve you really fast, but there’s a reason why its always full - their sundubuggi (tofu stew) is to die for.

Customers have a variety of choices, 18 different ways to have their tofu stew, ranging from ham and stew, beef, seafood to dumpling tofu stew, which all cost 7500 won each. Moreover, there’s a sign in the restaurant that says “please don’t crack eggs on your friends’ heads - yes, we had it happen before” in korean, lightening the restaurant's mood. 

Recommended food: Any of their sundubuggi but recommend the beef one specifically (7500 won)

### 5\. Daimon Kitchen

A wooden cottage-like building with the “One Piece” Pirate Flag hung in the interior - this lovely restaurant is a Japanese ramen food place located between Sinchon and Ewha. Even though it will take students an hour and a half to eat there and then go back to school, this restaurant was included in the list because of its superb tastes.

Daimon Kitchen is a good place to visit as it offers tasty ramen, with 3 slices of pork meat. It works from 9:00 - 22:00 and the different types of ramen (all in a huge bowl) cost between 6500 to 8500 won. 

Recommended food: Miso ramen (7500 won)

All in all, this is a short list of restaurants and cafeterias students can visit at Sinchon campus. This list, undeniably, has excluded other good restaurants and cafeterias located in and near Yonsei University, Sinchon campus. However, I am confident that I have covered the major, important ones that cost under 10,000 won. Also, I am hopeful that this list will help students to eat healthy and frequent meals during their stay in the university. After all, health is one of the most important qualities of life.
