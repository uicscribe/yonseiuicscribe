_Class of 2016, Comparative Literature & Culture major_

**Who's your favorite Animal Crossing villager and why?**

Out of the villagers I have currently, it’s gotta be Huck! I got him as my first campsite villager and thought his smug little mouth and wart nose were the most adorable thing. Added to that is the fact that as a frog villager, he has a huge head and tiny body, which makes giving him clothes such a joy.

**If you could teach a course on anything, what would it be?**

This is where my credentials as a literature major come in—at this very moment my choice would be a course on the depiction of domestic labor, more specifically culinary work, in late 20th century women’s middlebrow fiction. I’ve been cooking a lot these days, and reading cookbooks from both the contemporary age and the past alongside 19th and 20th century novels, I’m noticing how so much and so little has changed about the way we view the act of cooking and eating! 

**What’s your favorite TikTok?**

I have to shamefully admit that I joined TikTok during these trying times—partially out of cabin fever, but mostly because it looked fun? Please don’t judge me? My favorite one so far is the one that goes “The volume inside of this bus is astronomical”, it radiates such intense white lady middle school teacher vibes and gives me flashbacks to a suburban American childhood that I never even had.
