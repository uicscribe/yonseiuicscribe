Interview with Moritz, HASS division, major undecided.

**What’s your favorite class this semester?**

My favorite class this semester is World History with Professor Robert Beachy. I haven’t taken history classes for four years, so this class fills my knowledge gap pretty well. I also find the topic very interesting, which is “The History of Sexuality.” I was especially interested by how the concept of gender changed over time, from the ancient Romans to the modern era.

**What do you want to major in your sophomore year, and why?**

I would like to major in Sustainability Development and Cooperation. I’m interested in renewable energy and products, and would like to learn more of how we could develop sustainable lifestyles both for our well-being and for the environment.

**If you could take over the radio for one day, what kind of music would you play?**

I prefer listening to music I don’t understand, so I’d recommend something that sounds good, but in a language other than Turkish or English. I enjoy Russian, Spanish and French pop. Artists such as BlackM, Feduk, or Eldzhey are some of my favorites.
