Interview with Minh Le, Creative Technology Management major from the class of 2018.

**What is the highlight (most memorable moment) of your university life so far?**

The highlight of my university life is probably my freshman year. I got the opportunity to attend both AKARAKA and Yonko Games, two of the biggest events at Yonsei University. I had a lot of fun at these festivals, and it brought out the Yonsei spirit within me. So if you are a freshman, remember to give it a try. One small tip: having Friday-free helps!

**What is your favorite movie and why?**

My favorite movie is probably _Sunny_. It's a Korean movie. I simply enjoy it because I feel a sense of connection to it. Friends have always played a huge part in my life, and my friends at UIC have helped me through my down moments.

**Did you have any expectations or goals for 2020? If so, what was it?**

My plan for 2020 is to simply lead a healthy lifestyle by trying to balance my school and personal life and working on not letting any negative feelings get to me.
