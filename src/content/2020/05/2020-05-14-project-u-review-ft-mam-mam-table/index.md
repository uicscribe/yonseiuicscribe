Location: located in the small alleyway behind “No Brand”, takes 7 minutes by walking from the main entrance (40, Yonsei-ro 4-gil, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul)

### **Good**

- Whenever I want to reward myself with delicious food, I go to this place. My favorite menu is Bun cha which tastes like authentic Vietnamese food and is amazing
- All the menu are less than 8500 won and it is free to get extra rice or noodles
- There is a good photo spot outside with a pink background and cute lightings

### **Meh**

- It is recommended for a group of less than 3 people because it is a small place and has limited seating
- This place is usually very crowded so you have to wait in a line most of the times
- There are only 4 menus which are Cha Gio (fried spring rolls), Hu Tieu (beef noodle soup), Bun Cha (grilled pork with noodle), and Bun Chnh Chua (spicy noodle soup with seafood & mushroom)
