Sustainable Development and Cooperation, 18

**What is your latest topic of interest?**

It’s been months since Covid-19 has brought huge shifts and introduced new lifestyles and rules into our way of life. Given the crisis and these enormous transitions, people have recently become oblivious of over-using disposables, such as plastics. This, I feel, is a huge concern. I see people use plastic cups even at a cafe and wear protective face masks every day. But I never see anyone worrying about how much plastic waste now we generate. 

**What are your thoughts on the argument that the increased use of plastic today is a necessary evil?**

I recently shared a discussion with my friend who told me something similar: “People come first.” Sure, under the current circumstances, I agree that the overuse of daily disposables is inevitable. But we should start asking the question: what about when this is all over? We need to rethink and reconsider different dimensions of the side effects of our lifestyles today to pave the way for a more sustainable tomorrow, as well as a post-corona world.

**You seem very passionate about the subject. Are you working to resolve this issue, personally or through any projects? Or do you plan to?**

In the midst of confusing times, I, as a college student, wanted to take a small step on our campus. I am currently working with my colleagues on a campaign to promote the use of tumblers and personal cups. We are launching a “Tumbler Week Challenge” from May 18th to May 29th,  during which we encourage everyone to use personal cups and tumblers, instead of disposables. Please find us on Instagram (@tumbler\_week) and participate in our social media event! It’s a good cause...and there’s a prize!
