Interview with Sebin Lee, Underwood Division, Economics Major from the Class of 2017

**What prompted you to choose UIC?**

The open opportunities and numerous paths appeared very attractive to me as a person who sought challenges. In that aspect, I loved the fact that UIC was comprised of students and professors from all corners of the world, bringing in vigorous topics of conversations. The diversity allowed me to fully explore my interest and vision.

**What is your favorite experience at UIC so far?**

I greatly enjoyed my experience participating in CC courses due to their small class sizes. I have always wanted smaller class sizes to engage in heated debates with fellow students and professors. In addition, they provided space to study in a collaborative and open environment, which helped me thrive as a UIC-ian.

**How are you continuing your exchange program in face of COVID-19?**

Originally, I was to stay at the University of California Irvine on an exchange student program for 3 quarters. However, because of COVID-19, I was half-forced to come back to Korea 3 months earlier than planned. Wanting to continue the program, I decided to take courses taught via Zoom or other online education platforms. For the time being, the grades are given on the basis of quiz, homework and test scores.
