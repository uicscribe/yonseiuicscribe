Most students at Underwood International College (UIC) find the UIC tuition fee to be expensive. And sometimes, students cannot help but wonder, “but what are the perks of being a UIC student?” I, too, felt that way and so I researched about the UIC programs that are only offered exclusively to UIC students. Here are some of the opportunities and programs that UIC offers exclusively to UIC students that when taken advantage of, can better aid the students in developing their career paths. 

### **_1\. UIC alumni talks _**

Networking plays an important role in finding out about employment opportunities. Indeed, networking with UIC alumni is one of the best ways to get in contact with companies and institutions across diverse industries. One of the ways in which we can meet our alumni is through the UIC alumni talks. In an alumni talk event, UIC invites successful alumni in various fields to talk about how they were able to transition from being UIC students (just like you) to becoming a successful alumni. Last semester, International Studies (IS) Student Council hosted an alumni talk at Daewoo Annex Hall with an IS major graduate, Daewook Kwon. As a management consultant at McKinsey and Company, he gave an insightful talk about how he prepared himself at UIC to get into McKinsey Seoul office and then into McKinsey Amsterdam office. He shared the pros and cons of being in the consulting industry, his personal experience in the interview process, life at McKinsey and more. During the question and answer session, UIC students were able to ask him more personal questions, like what it is like to live in Amsterdam and how the work atmosphere is different from that of the Seoul office. He gave us a witty answer of how in the Seoul Office, you get to enjoy the perks of living in Korea and working with both Korean and international firms, whereas, in the Amsterdam Office, you get the perks of getting off work right at evening to enjoy dinner time with friends and family. This type of opportunity to get insight about what life is like at these top tier companies is not common, so I recommend you all to join in and ask questions that you were always curious about.

### **_2\. Career Development Center _**

For the most part, UIC students all have a common concern: getting a job. If you have any kind of questions or concerns on your future career, visiting the Career Development Center (CDC) for career advice may be a good place to start. Professors at CDC help a large group of students ranging from students, who do not know what they want to do in the future, to students who are in their last stage of finalizing their English resumes. This center is exclusively tailored to benefit UIC students, who have the advantage of making their resumes stand out amongst students from other majors. Appointments are available on the website and students can seek advice in both Sinchon and Songdo campus. However, those students, who do not need advice from the professors, can take advantage of CDC, as CDC regularly updates internship/job opportunities that are from respectable firms, like Naver, Hyundai Card, UN ESCAP, Amazon, and more.

### **_3\. UIC Scribe _**

If you hear about a newsmagazine club, you may think of a very academic-based club that publishes articles on serious issues with hard facts only. However, while there are articles on serious topics, UIC Scribe offers articles that are more intriguing- and one that has more of personal touch to every one of the articles. UIC scribe is the only student-run newsmagazine of UIC and is one of the two newsmagazine clubs at Yonsei University that is written in English. UIC Scribe is, just like the above programs, offered to UIC students exclusively. For those of you who are interested in writing and publishing creative articles, or just want a place to practice writing in general, UIC Scribe is an excellent place to consider. Reporters are required to write two articles: one UIC-related article and one of the reporter’s choice. However, this is the only guideline/requirement and the reporters are free to write about whatever they wish. To add a little more fun into the newsmagazine, there is also a section called “UIC Snapshots,” which is an interview with a UIC student, written like “The Humans of New York,” as well as, a section called “U Review,” introducing recommendable places around the school campus. Not only that, but well-written or creative articles also get a chance to feature in the two official issues of UIC Newsmagazine (Summer and Winter edition) to showcase the amazing works written by the students during the semester. If this intrigues you, don’t miss out on this opportunity and check out UIC Scribe on Facebook for more info! 

Here were just a few of the many great opportunities that are exclusively offered to UIC students. There is the Design Factory Korea (DFK), UIC Writing Center, Social Innovation and Creators’ Academia (SICA)-the list goes on and on. Now that you read this article and know more, I encourage you to go further and find out more about the motley of programs UIC offers and make efficient use out of them during your years at UIC.
