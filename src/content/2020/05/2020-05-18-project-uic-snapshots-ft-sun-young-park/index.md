Interview with Sun Young Park, Culture and Design Management Major, Class of 2017

**What is your hobby?**

About 3 months ago, I started learning ballet because I needed a sort of exercise and fortunately there is a ballet studio near my home. I am becoming more flexible day by day.

**Where would you like to live in the future? **

If I get a chance to choose where I live in the future, one option might be somewhere in America, which is still an unknown world to me - I already know life in Asia and Europe. But the thing is, I love enjoying the life in Seoul

**What advice would you give to freshmen at UIC? **

To UIC freshmen, I would advise them to do anything (unless it is illegal) they want to do during their college years because this could be the perfect opportunity to try out things without experiencing failure. They are all considered to be experiences.
