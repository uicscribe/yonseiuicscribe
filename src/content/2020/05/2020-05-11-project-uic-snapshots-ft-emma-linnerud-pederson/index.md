I had the honor to interview an awesome independent lady: Emma Linnerud Pederson whose majoring in SDC/PSIR and is about to graduate this semester.

**What are the life principles you follow or try to follow?**

I try to remind myself to be patient as good things take time, think twice about what I say, there is no reward in life without effort so work hard, and lastly: that whatever happens is not the end of the world and that I’ll be ok. Also, self-care is important!

**Name one of the attractive personality traits you have?**

I find effort and passion very attractive in other people and likewise I try to show my passion towards what I want to achieve in my life. Once I have a goal, that being anything from putting effort into helping friends, to homework, to work, I give it my all! And with a smile of course.

**If you were to be from a planet other than Earth, which planet would you be from? Why?**

Jupiter is the planet of faith, positivism, and optimism and we all need a bit of that in our lives - that’s why I’d want to be from Jupiter. Considering I’d weigh 170kg on Jupiter, I’d definitely need some more positivity too, lol.
