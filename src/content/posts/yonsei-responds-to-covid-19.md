A new outbreak of coronavirus from late April is taking another toll on Korea, and Yonsei University, as it turns out, is no exception in feeling its effects. Yonsei is taking measures to counter this unwelcomed progress. One aspect is that of dormitory check-ins. Early in the semester, the fall semester check-in for the International Campus dormitories in Songdo, was delayed until after the midterm exams, the eighth week of the semester. On October 16, however, the Yonsei International Campus Dormitory Administration office announced its revised plans to wholly cancel check-ins for everyone for the fall semester. Many students on anonymous communities like Everytime voiced their disappointments over not being able to spend a year in Songdo like their upperclassmen had done in the past.

Despite this fact, the Residential College programme will be held all-online, just as in the first semester. The requirements for the RC programme have also become more lenient when compared to the past semester, during which houses only granted RC points to students participating in their own house programmes. The reports that students are required to submit for RC points have become significantly shorter, and students can participate in other houses's events.

What this also means is that all classes will be conducted online even after the midterm exams. On October 7, the school board held a discussion about the safest means of carrying out classes after the midterm exams. On October 12, Yonsei finalized their plans to go online for the rest of the semester. Regular classes except those adopting the pass/no pass, or P/NP, grading system will be subject to absolute grading. Professors are advised to make this semester's tests open-note and open-book, so as to discourage potential cheaters. Since internet connection issues might arise while taking tests on Yonsei’s online school website YSCEC, it is advised that to divide the tests be divided into multiple sections and that students to save the answers as they go along. Professors and lecturers alike are implementing many different methods to discourage cheating, such as using ZOOM to show the students’ desks during tests and mixing the order of questions for online quizzes so as to make the exam look different for all students.

According to school policy, final exams in December should be carried out non- face-to-face as well. Classes that were originally planned to be blended learning courses (which is alternating between offline and online classes) or face-to-face can meet in person on condition. Only less than ten people can assemble at the same time in a classroom, and everyone must go through a temperature and symptom check before entering the room.

Many other activities are also being carried out online, such as the biannual Club Expo, an event which introduces various clubs within the university. The Club Expo was held online in the semester as well. There are many student clubs that are striving to work on an all-online basis despite the struggles due to COVID-19. This year's AKARAKA, Yonsei’s annual school festival which was postponed, is also going to be an online event, and will consist of sharing videos that include memories of cheering for Yonsei.

Another policy implemented by Yonsei University is “Course Withdrawal for Emergency.” The Course Withdrawal for Emergency is a policy specifically implemented for the 2020 spring semester. It aims to remedy the shortcomings of the first-ever online semester in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, including-but not limited to-technical problems related to online lectures and poor learning environments (such as an unstable network environment) that may have generated unfair evaluations. Through this policy, undergraduates who enrolled during the spring semester can give up their grade for one class. This was welcomed by many students who worried about potential cheaters who may negatively impact their grades. In the case of the Course Withdrawal, the course that is withdrawn will be marked as WE (meaning Withdrawn for Emergency Situation) and will be excluded from the overall calculation of the GPA. Students should keep in mind, though, that those who withdraw their courses are not eligible for academic honours and awards, and scholarships will be given based on the grades before the withdrawal.

Even though this is a difficult semester, all members of the Yonsei community are working together to weather this crisis. Hopefully, by this time next year, everything will be back to normalcy and the campus will be full of students.
