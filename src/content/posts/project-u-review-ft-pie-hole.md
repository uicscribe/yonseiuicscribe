Location: it’s close to the Main Street of sinchon, near Uplex. Just walk near the small park at the back of the Hyundai department store. You’ll find a small alley with the café!

**Good**

* The mood and atmosphere are great at this cafe. There’s a terrace section at the back that’s decorated with fairy lights and stars. This is a great place to bring your friends for some dessert and coffee.
* The pastries and pies are freshly made everyday and definitely a treat.
* Try the earl grey pie or matcha pie!

**Meh**

* There’s a limited serving of dessert. If you go to the café after dinner, many menus might already be sold out.
* If you go during the really busy hours, it might be hard to get a good table.
