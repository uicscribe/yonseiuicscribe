Location: The café is a 20 minutes walk from the main gate of the Songdo International Campus. To get to Triple Street, where the café is located, turn right and go straight after coming out of the campus. Turn left when seeing the big apartment complex (Songdo More Store Triple Tower) and go straight. When arriving at the commercial district, take the elevator and go to the second floor. The café’s in the A section, next to Cheongdam Galbi Myeonok.

(Specific address of Triple Street: 33-3, 16beon-gil, Songdo Gwahak-ro, Yeonsu-gu, Incheon)

**Good**

* There is a wide range of drinks to choose from. There is especially a wide variety of teas available, ranging from pomegranate omija to chamomile lemon tea.
* When ordering a drink, you get served a small Korean delice (yakgwa) for free.
* The price of the drinks and snacks are not very expensive and certainly affordable compared to other coffee brands. A 330ml hot americano is 3400 won.
* The atmosphere of the café is very calm and appropriate for studying. There are diverse tables to sit at and study, ranging from simple tables to Japanese-style kotatsus. Also, there are not many people in the café, so the café is not bustling and great to concentrate.
* What makes this café unique are the traditionally Korean drinks and snacks – like Ssangwha, Jujube Licorice, and yakgwa – so you can get a unique experience of tasting Korean traditional drinks and snacks.

**Meh**

* The variety of coffee that you can order is limited compared to the variety of tea. There are only six coffee types (americano, café latte, vanilla latte, cafe mocha, caramel macchiato, and choco latte) that can be ordered.
* The coffee sold here is bland and ordinary, so it might not be the best place for coffee lovers wanting to taste good coffee.
* The café is quite a long walk from campus, so beware.

If you are a tea lover and are searching for an amical, quiet, unique café to study near the international campus, this is the place you’re searching for!
