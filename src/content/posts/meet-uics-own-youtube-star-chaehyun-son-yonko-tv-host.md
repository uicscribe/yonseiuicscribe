YonKo TV is a YouTube channel that serves as a virtual platform for mentors from Yonsei and Korea University to share tips and insights for students in the midst of their college admission process. Since 2016, the channel has risen to prominence and amassed over 420,000 subscribers. Among the repertoire of creators is UIC’s very own Chaehyun Son. She joined Yonko TV in early 2019 and has been an active member since, featuring in multiple videos under her stage name “Hana”. UIC Scribe had the opportunity to interview her to learn more about her work process and identity as a content creator.

**Students of all ages follow YonKo TV and you are in a position where you can impact the lives of many students. How do you feel to be a part of such an influential channel?**

We are extremely thankful to our subscribers. All the kind and encouraging words we receive let us know that our hard work actually impacts people and that is a proud moment for us. While I am thankful for their faith in me, it also makes me question if I am worthy of that admiration. That sense of responsibility pushes me to be a better person.

**YonKo TV attempts to create diverse and experimental content. Could you give us a glimpse of the process creators go through?**

The crew mainly consists of creators and producers, some of them are in charge of planning and the rest of them of editing. Simply put, the producers outline the general structure of the content and the creators add substance to it. For example, if the topic is about cramming, the creators would brainstorm ideas and tips based on their personal experiences and write a proposal. With the fleshed-out proposal, the shooting begins. The creators then focus on delivering the content in the most enjoyable, entertaining way. After countless editing and revisions with the film crew, the final product is released to the public.

**For those who want to become a creator like you, could you share some advice?**

Regarding an essential quality for a YouTuber, I believe one must have a story or a character he or she wishes to share with the world. It would be of great strength if one has a unique, distinguishing story, but the earnestness with which you convey your message would be of utmost importance. Attitude is a critical requisite, which is often overlooked.

Another thing I must address is that having a strong mentality is crucial. Even in a channel as mild as YonKo TV, there are still baseless slurs. It was challenging for me to deal with them at first, but I trained myself to not take them seriously.

One must also be eager to absorb ideas from other channels in a similar field. One must continuously strive to learn from others, even if they’re your competitors. Since YouTube is a time-sensitive market, one must be also attentive to trends.

**As a part of a renowned YouTube channel, you have a massive number of followers. How did that influence your life?**

It was very challenging for me initially. Since I joined YonKo TV from my first year, I unavoidably had to miss out on major freshmen events due to the busy shooting schedule. The year as a whole was quite far from what I expected my first year to be, so I struggled both physically and mentally. However, I eventually got used to it and was able to see that the experiences in YonKo TV define who I am now. Since the end of my contract is closing in, the sorrow of parting is stirring up in my heart and that is when you know something actually mattered to you.

**It has already been four years now since the channel started. As a member of YonKo TV, what is the thing, value, or philosophy you would want to keep in mind as it progresses? How would you want YonKo TV to be remembered?**

First of all, our contents always endeavor to be resourceful for the students.

The second goal would be entertainment. Students visit our channel to take a rest from their stressful studying. That is why we intentionally design contents that display the exciting part of college life such as vlogs, Akaraka, and Yon-Ko games.

To answer the second part, I hope the fans would not put us on pedestals, distancing themselves from us. We would like to be the friendly “oppas” and “unnies” who they can find comfort and consolation from no matter what they are going through. I recall one of my fans writing to me about how I inspired her to pursue her dream. That truly touched me. We are here to remind students around Korea that they can achieve their goals too, just like any of us. They are all full of potential and if we have been of any help in realizing that important fact, we would be profoundly grateful. If they could look back on YonKo TV with memories of joy and passionate engagement, it would be enough for us.
