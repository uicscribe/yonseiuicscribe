Interview with Michele Resele, who started in the fall of 2020. Majoring in Underwood Division, Political Science and International Relations. She’s a General Officer in UGC and a member of the YUU Debate Club.

**What is your typical day in college?**

I actually signed up for 9 AM classes. I get up at 8:50 and still make it in time. Getting up earlier does drive me to be more productive during the day. I end the night watching Netflix just to put my mind at ease.

**What’s a hobby that you love?**

I actually love to read for fun. I’ve been reading a lot of dystopian fiction, and it always leaves me wondering how authors come to imagine the world they write about.

**Why did you decide to come to attend Yonsei University?**

Yonsei was not my first choice. Actually, I was planning on going to Canada. However, once I received my acceptance letter from Yonsei, I started thinking about the bigger picture. Career wise, I do want to work and live in Asia in the future, and Korea is such a central hub for innovation and creative thinking. I think I made the right decision in coming here! No regrets!
