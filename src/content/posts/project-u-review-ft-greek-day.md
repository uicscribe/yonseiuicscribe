**Good**

* Greek Day has one of the chewiest, thickest, most concentrated greek yogurts you can find in Seoul. Unlike other products, this yogurt has a subdued lactic tang that refrains from overpowering the toppings.
* You can customize the seasonal toppings and honey to make your own perfect cup.
* In true COVID-fashion, Greek Day now delivers yogurt right to your house!

**Meh**

* As is the case with all popular shops in Sinchon, the lines can get quite long in the afternoon.
* A few years ago, someone found a strand of armpit hair in their yogurt and posted it on Facebook. Rest be assured, all Greek Day employees now regularly get full-body waxes. No more need to worry about finding extra protein in your yogurt!
