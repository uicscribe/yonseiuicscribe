Location: Sinchon Hwangso Gopchang is roughly about five minutes’ walk from the main gate at the Sinchon campus. Cross the road in front of the gate and walk until you reach the Olive Young drugstore. Then take a turn into the smaller street on the right. Walk on until you see the Izakaya, and turn left once more.

Good:

* All things considered, you will certainly get your money’s worth. It’s relatively inexpensive as gopchangs go, with its signature menu standing at less than twenty thousand won.
* What they call the “drug” powder on the gopchang is some pretty heavenly material and definitely a must for connoisseurs and laypeople alike!
* It looks like it has high enough table turnover rates overall. Yon won’t be forced to wait for eons until you are finally presented with your food.

Meh:

* For some inexplicable reason, fried rice (usually serviced after the meal in most restaurants of this type) is not available on weekends - it may pose as a major disappointment to some.
* Side dish is somewhat lacking, so beware.
* The part-timers here are not always the kindest, although it is something that might vary from time to time.
