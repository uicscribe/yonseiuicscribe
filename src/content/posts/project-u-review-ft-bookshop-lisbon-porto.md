Location: As you approach the end of Gyeongui Line Forest Park which stretches from Hongik University Station Exit 3 (Yeonnam-dong) to Gajwa Station, look at the right side of the street. You will find a place which looks like a residential area at first glance but locates many cafes and shops alongside.

**Good:**

* As the place is located on the outskirts of the crowded Yeonnam-dong, many of the books radiate a tranquil vibe, empowering readers to cherish every trivial moment in life. Nonetheless, the bookshop also works as a busy café full of energy, selling various drinks and dessert.
* Though the second floor is directly connected to the first floor, the cozy and unique interior makes you feel like you’re in your own personal hideout space. You can read without any disturbance. On the top floor, visitors can enjoy art exhibitions and leave short memos of their visits in a scrapbook.
* Since the shop often arranges socializing events like casual book talks and weekend reading meets with wine, it would be a great chance to meet people sharing similar interests despite circumstances under COVID-19 which make it difficult to meet new people.

**Meh:**

* Most of the seats are right outside the store, so if you’re not a big fan of outdoor seats, you may better enjoy other stores of larger scale.
* The stairs leading up to the third floor seem a bit dangerous – make sure to wear comfortable clothes and shoes when visiting the top floor!
