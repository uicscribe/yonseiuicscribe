2020 will be remembered as the year of the COVID-19 pandemic. It has affected everyone’s daily lives. People are recommended to stay indoors and health departments all over the world emphasize the importance of masks. University is no different. All spring semester courses have been held online, which is continuing during the fall as well. The virus is not going away anytime soon, but scientists and pharmaceutical companies are working hard to create a vaccine. Although the pandemic will hopefully be under control in a few years, it will have far-reaching changes, and UIC will be no exception.

Post-COVID-19 life will allow flexible use of online courses. It was abrupt, but Coronavirus has shown us that life is possible without face-to-face contact. Many people work at home, and students are attending university through videos made by professors or Zoom lectures. Direct contact is preferred, but technology allows for the same work to be done in a remote way. Before the pandemic, video chat was considered to be laggy and tedious. However, online meetings and lectures have been an indispensable part of daily life for almost a year now, and the quality has greatly improved. Even after the virus is under control, Zoom will continue to be regularly used. “Blended Learning,” a term that Yonsei uses to define classes held both online and offline, is likely to be used more frequently in the future. Professors will have the choice to make their classes partially online if they think it necessary. Lectures that do not demand much interaction between students and professors can be dealt with more efficiently online. For example, lectures such as Eastern and Western Civilization consist of around 200 students and 1 professor. It is not a class that requires active participation, so there is low interaction.

The use of online courses can benefit students who have classes in both Sinchon and Songdo, because they would no longer need to commute between the two campuses. Although freshmen attend their classes only in Songdo, sophomores and above majoring in Humanities, Arts, and Social Studies Division (HASSD) or Integrated Science and Engineering Division (ISED) can have classes in both campuses. Currently, they have to consider the shuttle bus when making schedules. Online courses can allow them more variety and flexibility in their schedules. Some courses like Chapel do not take away any space in students’ schedules. Participants have the option to watch the lecture anytime within a week. Apart from students, professors can also benefit as well. For the classes with less participation, they can post compact videos filled with only the essential information of the lessons. Posting videos can also lessen worries about interruptive conditions like technical difficulties.

Nonetheless, the quality is questionable. It is the main reason that many students have been arguing for a partial refund of their tuition. Some cases in other Korean universities involved [professors only posting links to YouTube videos.](https://news.unn.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=226900) The article mentions that students are unable to cope with these situations. The corresponding universities say that watching videos made by third parties is within the boundary of “online courses.” Another problem that has been related to online teaching has been students cheating during exams. Students can share their answers with one another, which negatively affects their education and is unfair to their peers. It has been a problem involving most universities in Korea. Unfortunately, such [cases occurred in Yonsei as well.](https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=102&oid=586&aid=0000014608)

For online courses to become the new normal in a Post-Pandemic world, these problems need to be addressed thoroughly. Many foresaw the widespread use of online classes and untact technology, they did not anticipate it to be reality so soon. The pandemic let humans know it is currently possible. After the pandemic, professors will decide whether their course will be held offline, online or blended. UIC Seminars and Common Curriculum courses encourage active participation, so they may be held offline. For courses that require relatively less interaction, it will be up to the professors. Though there are issues to fix, it will be an inevitable change in the coming years.
