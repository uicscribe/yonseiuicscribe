Location: located across the street from Korea Coast Guard, and is near Songdo Central Park

**Good**

* It is the most popular bagel shop in Songdo and has a variety of cream cheese and fresh bagels that are made daily
* If you want a light meal or something simple, you can just get a bagel with cream cheese of your choice, and if you want it for breakfast or lunch, a bagel sandwich is also possible
* A good choice for picnic food because it is near Central Park and easy to takeout

**Meh**

* The place is small and is not a good place to hang out or chat inside
* It is pretty far away from the campus. It takes around 45 minutes by walk, 15 minutes by car, and 30 minutes if you take the bus 91 or 92
* It is not open on Mondays and if you go there late in the afternoon or evening, some bagels might be sold out
