Location: about 10 min walk from the Muak Dormitory, next to the Seodaemun Fire Station



**Good**:

* Has a very kind owner and helpful staff.
* Very nice and new cozy interior, spacious restaurant with a casual atmosphere. Beautiful decorations and a nice view from the big window.
* Everything offered looks amazing (and tastes great as well) and the menu combines a variety of different cuisines – from Mexican Chili Burger to Kung Pao Tofu Rice or Konkuksu style noodles. All vegan but you won’t even notice.



**Meh**:

* The price is a bit higher than your average diner.
* There is a break time from 3 to 5 pm, so be careful to note the time when visiting.
