Interview with Jeon Young Mok, Energy & Environmental Science and Engineering (EESE) major from the class of 2017.

**Quarantineâ€™s got us all finding entertainment at home.** **Out of all the movies and shows you watched recently, what is your most favorite?**

Bojack Horseman on Netflix. The raw comedy and its depiction of the loop of hedonism, immorality, and guilt spoke to me in an authentic, personal level.

**In all your time in UIC so far, what was your most favorite class?**

World Philosophy by Prof. Bennett Holman.

He hijacked that class to actually teach about Social Epistemology. It was a wild ride, as it breaks the conventional foundations of truth-finding, but in the end it leads you to build a more robust and conscious foundation.

**Most fun thing you've done in 2020?**

My team of UIC students and I won the POSTECH UGRP competition (joint-second place; no first place awarded this year) by submitting our research report of a polymer capable of detecting heavy metals in water. It was immensely fun to work in a lab with my teammates and struggling to get the material to yield results.
