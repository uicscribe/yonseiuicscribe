Professor Sunghee Pak teaches three sections of the Freshman Writing Intensive Seminar (FWIS). She double-majored in English and French at Yonsei for her undergraduate degree and attended the English Language and Literature Department of Yonsei Graduate School. Then, she was riveted by drama as a genre in literature, so she went to University of Wisconsin-Madison where she ultimately earned her PhD.

As a student in her Freshman Writing Intensive Seminar class in the Fall of 2020, I would like to recommend her class to all incoming freshmen. Professor Sunghee indulges in in-depth analysis of the texts and films that are assigned. She engages students in deep conversations and encourages thinking outside of the box. Even though having discussion-heavy classes online is no easy feat, she is invested in hearing from all students and giving them insightful feedback on their contributions.

**How did you gain enthusiasm towards writing and English?**

I’m a literature kind of person. My house was filled with books. I didn’t know that it was unusual back then, but my parents used to say, “Play around at a bookstore or a library.” They always associated the word “play” with books, not with studying. They let me pick out any books that I wanted to read. I thought literature was fun instead of something that I should do out of duty, so I got into literature at a pretty early age. As for writing, I started pretty late. As I was doing my MA at Yonsei, I was working as a tutor at the Yonsei Writing Tutoring Service. It was one-on-one sessions, so I could help others more efficiently. I continued tutoring at Wisconsin-Madison as well. I didn’t love it at first because it’s difficult to teach writing. However, when writers get enthusiastic about writing, I can see their passion and how they shape their thoughts and ideas on paper. This gives a sense of satisfaction to both of us. When I started teaching writing, it was mostly freshmen because it’s a required course for them. They have diverse backgrounds, so their writing expresses their personal experiences and is cool to read. In short, the writers’ enthusiasm got me into writing even though I was not a fan of it at first.

**How did you discover UIC? What made you decide to work here?**

I was looking for a lecturer job in Korea because I was planning to return after wrapping up my dissertation. My friends recommended the position at UIC to me, so I decided to apply. Actually, it was surprising because I gathered the application material late and in haste because I didn’t have time because of my dissertation. The short answer is fortunate timing.

**What are your UIC students like? What do you expect from them?**

My students are doing pretty well in my classes especially considering that we have to do discussion-based classes online. We can’t read the class atmosphere or really engage that much, so given these restrictions I think that my students are doing well. One thing that I want to tell them is that I think that they worry too much about grades. Maybe, that will lead them to stay in their safe zone because they don’t want to damage their grades. Ironically, this will cause their grades not to go beyond a certain range because they are limiting their creativity. I want them to think freely because this is a writing class. There is no right answer. There are many wrong answers, but there are also many ways to write good answers. As college students, they should take more initiative when it comes to their assignments.

**What are your current research interests?**

My research interest revolves around the representation of race and gender in Shakespeare intertexts, the works adapted from or inspired by Shakespeare's plays. Currently, I'm focusing on the portrayal of Cleopatra and Othello in several pieces of Shakespeare adaptations.

**Do you have any future aspirations or plans for next semester or beyond it?**

I want to have a chance to teach drama because my passion lies in dramatic literature. My dream class would be to teach dramatic literature and act out some of it. I also want to have a fantasy-related literature class, where we read “Harry Potter,” “Hunger Games,” “Beowulf,” “Alice in Wonderland,” and works by Tolkien. I want to discuss what these works impart on this generation in class. As for next semester, I’ll still be here teaching FWIS. I hope we have in-person classes, but if not, then I’ll be teaching from home.
