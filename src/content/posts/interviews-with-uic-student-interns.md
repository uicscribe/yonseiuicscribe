## Yooyeon Cha (PSIR 18)

**Job Description**

Data processing assistant and research analyst at Bering Lab (associated company of Bering Legal)

**Main Tasks**

I mainly processed data and conducted statistical analysis to develop our firm’s globally acclaimed AI legal patent translation machine. To fully analyze the growth potential of this service, I worked with my team to explore the Asian market, investigate privacy concerns, and provide the basic framework for the service’s terms and conditions.

**Lessons Learned**

The most striking characteristic of Bering Lab was that its lawyers and software developers all came from drastically different walks of life. I realized through this observation that there are copious paths to professional success that may seem unorthodox. What is most crucial is to develop a specialized identity through a specific career blueprint: i.e. planning out where you want to live in the future, what you want to do after graduation, etc. On a more practical note, it is imperative to consider personal issues like financial capacity and family plans. Taking such considerations more seriously will aid you in making decisions now, whether they be school courses, extra-curricular activities, or internships.

**Helpful Courses**

When I was a sophomore, I took Professor Seungmin Jung’s Law and Technology course and was so intrigued that I decided to become a data security lawyer. With that in mind, I have focused on taking relevant courses and participating in extracurriculars related to data, law, and the 4th industrial revolution.

**Further Advice**

Internships are not necessarily the optimal activity for your resume! Rather, try to do things that you can do only as a university student like club activities, undergraduate competitions, and volunteer work. Remember, internships are only helpful if they fit seamlessly into your career plan.

## Yoonjung Baek (CTM 18)

**Job description**

Contents team intern at English education app company Cake

**Main Tasks**

At Cake, I assist in creating content, developing marketing strategies, curating videos, and managing social media platforms. For those who are unfamiliar with Cake: it is the most popular education app in 55 countries and is committed to teaching English through short-form videos.

**Lessons Learned**

During my three months at Cake, I learned the importance of recognizing media trends and incorporating them into our services. This is especially important for Cake, as it is an IT service evaluated on external factors such as views, reviews, and visitors. Due to this, it is crucial to understand what content intrigues users and how to keep them focused for long periods of time. I think that Cake is able to be as successful as it is due to its ability to incorporate trends in an educational, timely manner.

**Helpful Courses**

The most helpful course for me has been Professor Bogyum Kim’s Strategic Marketing class. Here, I learned about various marketing theories and was able to apply this knowledge at work. However, I definitely felt that such theoretical classes are too traditional to address the fast-paced digitalization and technological developments that IT firms are subject to. As such, I would love to take classes related to more contemporary digital marketing and data analysis in the future.

**Further Advice**

Try to be more active and participate in as many activities as you can! Personally, I was so afraid of failing that the application process itself seemed daunting. Now, I understand the importance of putting this fear behind me to strive towards a brighter future. Even if you do fail, writing resumes and participating in recruitment processes is a valuable opportunity for self-reflection. My past work experiences as a contents creator at SNOW and a data analyst at Data Marketing Korea may seem unrelated to my current job, but they all helped me overcome my fear of failure and opened doors to a future in marketing. Experience doesn’t just come knocking at your door. Go find it!

## Dabin Kim (IS 18)

**Job Description**

Assistant marketing manager and translator at The Prizm Entertainment.

**Main Tasks**

My first task at The Prizm Entertainment was translating for Russian model Angelina Danilova. After that, I took on a more central role at the firm, organizing and participating in meetings with screenwriters, producers, and advertisers. I also coordinated various promotion events for Angelina and spent a hefty amount of time on-set providing direct assistance to our firm’s projects.

**Lessons Learned**

Earning money is hard? (Laughs) I think the biggest lesson I learned is the importance of striking a healthy balance between what I like and what I am good at. For example, translating is something that I have ample experience with and am competent at, but do not particularly savor. I plan on devoting the remainder of my college years to reflect upon my strengths and interests.

**Helpful Courses**

The UIC Common Curriculum courses I took as a freshman definitely aided me in honing my problem-solving skills and creativity. The UIC Career Development Center also helped me immensely, as it offers many internship opportunities and detailed instructions on writing attractive cover letters and resumes. Admittedly though, I struggled at first to transfer my coursework to meet the firm’s demands, as entertainment is not a common path chosen by UIC students and thus not dealt with extensively in classes.

**Further Advice**

Some internships may require you to step out of your comfort zone. For example, I tend to be more introverted and prefer independent work over team projects. However, my current job necessitates me to forge professional relations with a wide variety of people of all types. As such, I struggled a bit at first to adapt to this environment, but soon became perfectly comfortable with meeting and socializing with new people. Although it may seem intimidating to debark your comfort bubble, I think that it is an invaluable step in growing as a mature, responsible adult!
