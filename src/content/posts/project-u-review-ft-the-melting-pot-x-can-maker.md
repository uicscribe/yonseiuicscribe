Location: This awesome burger joint is a short 5-minute walk from the main gate of Yonsei Universityâ€™s Sinchon Campus.

**Good**

\- If you are looking for a good burger for an affordable price, The Melting Pot is what you are looking for. The burger patties are juicy and the French-fries extremely crispy yet soft!

\- They may only offer four different types of burgers, but you will quickly realise that they cover all bases and there is no need for more options.

\- The industrial design of the interior and dim ambient lighting makes the shop a perfect spot to have a casual lunch with friends.

**Meh**

\- The restaurant signboard is not very noticeable, and makes the place easy to miss unless the neon writing is lit up during the evening.

\- Burger purists will lament the fact that these burgers are stuffed too heavily to eat with bare hands and will require forks and knives.

\- The craft beer is only served in disposable plastic cups.
