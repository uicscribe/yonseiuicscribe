Location: Around the Ewha University Road, a nice twenty-minutes' walk from the Yonsei main gate. The name is Nangman Siktak, literally romance dining table in Korean, and it specializes in Japanese homemade cuisine.



**Good:**

* A good soy shrimp is not an easy feat to pull off, but Nangman Siktak has never failed here.
* The salmon dishes, including sake don - the signature dish, it seems - are simply heavenly. Strongly recommended.



**Meh:**

* The restaurant is quite small. Great when you're dining alone; not as good when you're with company.
* The quantity is somewhat questionable, especially considering the price level - which is far from cheap. Lacking, one might say.
