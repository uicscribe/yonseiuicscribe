Even with the vaccinations flooding in, in September 2021, South Korea saw a huge increase in confirmed COVID-19 cases. The subsequent cancellation of the first round of Songdo International Campus Dormitories Housing was a massive disappointment for many Yonsei students, especially the class of 2021. One is bound to feel an eerie feeling of déjà vu. Wasn’t the previous year full of similar cancellations as well? As a student of the class of 2020 that spent three full semesters completely online, this was definitely not easy. However, as the saying goes, every cloud has a silver lining. Provided that we’re stuck with “Cyber Yonsei” for the indefinite future, we might as well look into ways to make the best of this situation.

The most widespread concern for the class of 2021 (as well as the class of 2020) was with forming college relationships – or the lack of it, to be more precise. How do you make acquaintances, let alone friends, in this era of non-face-to-face interaction? Admittedly, there aren’t as many ways to get engaged with college life as before. But that doesn’t mean that there are absolutely no solutions around this. One good way is to join school clubs that hold regular meetings through Zoom. There are still quite a number of clubs holding online meetings (including our very own Yonsei UIC Scribe), so why not join one that piques your interest? Another way is to join the UIC student council. Engaging with student communities at Yonsei will definitely broaden your interpersonal network.

Another way to spend your time more productively is to learn programmes and tools such as Adobe or MS Office. Did you know that all Yonsei students can download and use Adobe programmes such as Photoshop, Premier Pro, and After Effects through Y-DEC for free? Or, did you know that you can also download MS Office at no cost? Learning these tools in your spare time will definitely help you with your job prospects. Not sure where to start, though? Fear not! Not only does Yonsei provide the programmes for free, but it also provides special lectures that teach you to make the most of these tools. Use your Yonsei portal ID to check out these special lectures and sign up early.

Finally, another simple tip that many of you are already aware of is to make full use of Yonsei Everytime or Yonple, which are online communities frequented by your fellow students. You can join or create Open Kakaotalk Chatrooms for your lectures to share information and ask questions. These chat rooms are especially useful for online lectures when you have unexpected technical difficulties and get kicked out of the Zoom. You can simply ask anyone in the chat to tell the professor to look at the waiting list for the Zoom room. Also, you can buy and sell used textbooks on Yonsei Everytime for a fraction of the market price for new books. Furthermore, you can pick which classes to take by referring to the reviews left by past students!

So far, we have looked at the ways through which we can take advantage of Yonsei University to the fullest. In these difficult times, however, the most important thing is not giving up and continuing to do our best, regardless of whether we are at home or at school. In other words, resilience is key. Here’s to hoping that we will be able to meet on campus soon. Until then, let’s live life at “Cyber Yonsei” to its fullest.
